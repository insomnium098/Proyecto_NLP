TGF-b1 induces Fstl1 via the Smad3-c-Jun pathway in lung fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 has long been regarded as a central mediator of tissue fibrosis. Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) is a crucial profibrotic glycoprotein that is upregulated in fibrotic lung tissues, and it promotes fibrogenesis via facilitating TGF-b signaling. Here we examined the signaling pathway by which TGF-b1 upregulates Fstl1 expression in mouse pulmonary fibroblasts. TGF-b1 regulated Fstl1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Although TGF-b1 rapidly activated the Smad, MAPK, and Akt pathways in lung fibroblasts, only Smad2/3 inhibition eliminated TGF-b1-induced Fstl1 expression. Analysis of the luciferase reporter activity identified a functional c-Jun transcription site in the Fstl1 promoter. Our results suggested a critical role for the Smad3-c-Jun pathway in the regulation of Fstl1 expression by TGF-b1 during fibrogenesis.
