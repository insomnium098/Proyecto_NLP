[Quantifying plasma levels of transforming growth factor beta1 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]. OBJECTIVE: Transforming growth factor ss1 (TGF-ss1) is one of the key profibrotic mediators in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of quantifying TGF-ss1 levels in patients with IPF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 29 IPF patients and 27 healthy controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify TGF-ss1 levels. RESULTS: Mean (SD) TGF-ss1 levels were significantly higher in the IPF patients than in the control subjects (11.1 [7.5] ng/mL vs 4 [2.4] ng/mL; P< .01). Weak inverse correlations were observed between TGF-ss1 levels and both forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. Thirteen IPF patients were evaluated at 8 (1.2) months (range, 5-9 months). The mean TGF-ss1 level was 18.2 (15) ng/mL and there were no significant differences with respect to the initial measurement of 11.1 (7.5) ng/mL. No correlation was observed between changes in respiratory function and changes in TGF-ss1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although plasma levels of TGF-beta1 were high in the patients with IPF, they do not appear to be a useful prognostic marker of disease activity or therapeutic response.
