Cytokine profiles in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis suggest an important role for TGF-beta and IL-10. Modulation of cytokine expression represents a potentially useful approach for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To identify potential targets for such intervention, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to compare the expression of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) coding for 17 cytokines in lung tissue obtained from patients with IPF at the time of diagnosis and control subjects. Some cytokines were also studied at the protein level by immunohistochemical techniques. mRNAs coding for all of the cytokines evaluated were detected in both control and fibrotic lung samples. Only transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-10 mRNAs were quantitatively increased in lung biopsies from patients with IPF compared with those of controls, results confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Although mRNAs for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) were expressed in similar amounts in lungs from patients with IPF and controls, localised accumulation of both factors was also observed in IPF. Hyperplastic alveolar epithelial cells were a prominent source of cytokines, where IL-10, PDGF-BB and KGF were present in increased amounts, although increased accumulation in fibroblasts, smooth-muscle cells and matrix components was also observed (PDGF-BB, TGF-beta). These results offer new insights into the cytokines produced in the lung in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and suggest that modulation of the production of transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-10 may represent a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for this disabling disease.
