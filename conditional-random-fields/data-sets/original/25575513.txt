Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-19 deficient fibroblasts display a profibrotic phenotype. UNASSIGNED: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by aberrant activation of epithelial cells that induce the migration, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. The resulting distinctive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci are responsible for the excessive extracellular matrix production, and abnormal lung remodeling. We have recently found that Mmp19-/- mice develop an exaggerated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis but the mechanisms are unclear. In this study we explored the effect of MMP19 deficiency on fibroblast gene expression and cell behavior. Microarray analysis of Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts revealed the dysregulation of several profibrotic pathways including extracellular matrix formation, migration, proliferation and autophagy. Functional studies confirmed these findings. Compared with wild type mice, Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts showed increased alpha 1 (I) collagen gene and collagen protein production at baseline and after TGF-b treatment, and increased smooth muscle alpha actin expression (p< 0.05). Likewise, Mmp19-deficient lung fibroblasts showed a significant increase in growth rate (p< 0.01), and in transmigration and locomotion over Boyden chambers coated with type I collagen or with Matrigel (p< 0.05). These findings suggest that in lung fibroblasts, MMP-19 has strong regulatory effects on the synthesis of key ECM components, on fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and in migration and proliferation.
