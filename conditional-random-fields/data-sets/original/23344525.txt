TGF-b1 T869C polymorphism may affect susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and disease severity. BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1) is a key cytokine that plays a critical role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The genotypes of T869C polymorphism may be associated with the susceptibility to fibrotic lung disease. METHODS: We investigated a single-nucleotide polymorphism at exon 1 nucleotide position 29 (T   >   C) of the TGF-b1 gene. Eighty-five healthy controls and 85 subjects with surgically confirmed IPF were investigated using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism techniques. RESULTS: The IPF patients consisted of 55 men and 30 women. The mean age was 61      8  years. Fifty-one (60  %) of the 85 IPF patients were smokers and 34 were nonsmokers. The distribution of genotypes between IPF patients and controls was significantly different (IPF: TT 43.5  % and TC or CC 56.5  %; controls: TT 27.1  % and TC or CC 72.9  %, p  =  0.037). TT genotype was significantly associated with decreased PaO2 and increased D(A-a)O2 upon initial diagnosis (p  =  0.006 and 0.009, respectively). There was a positive association between TT genotype and IPF development (odds ratio [OR]  =  2.1, 95  % confidence interval [CI]  =  1.1-4.0, p  =  0.028). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the TGF-b1 gene T869C polymorphism may affect susceptibility to IPF in Koreans. Larger studies are required to confirm the genetic association of TGF-b1 gene polymorphism and IPF.
