VCAM-1 is a TGF-b1 inducible gene upregulated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. UNASSIGNED: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lethal interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. We previously reported that high plasma levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) predict mortality in IPF subjects. Here we investigated the cellular origin and potential role of VCAM-1 in regulating primary lung fibroblast behavior. VCAM-1 mRNA was significantly increased in lungs of subjects with IPF compared to lungs from control subjects (p=0.001), and it negatively correlated with two markers of lung function, forced vital capacity (FVC) and pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). VCAM-1 protein levels were highly expressed in IPF subjects where it was detected in fibrotic foci and blood vessels of IPF lung. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with TGF-b1 significantly increased steady-state VCAM1 mRNA and protein levels without affecting VCAM1 mRNA stability. Further, cellular depletion of VCAM-1 inhibited fibroblast cell proliferation and reduced G2/M and S phases of the cell cycle suggestive of cell cycle arrest. These effects on cell cycle progression triggered by VCAM1 depletion were associated with reductions in levels of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclin D1. Thus, these observations suggest that VCAM-1 is a TGF-b1 responsive mediator that partakes in fibroblast proliferation in subjects with IPF.
