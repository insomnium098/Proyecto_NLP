Effect of Renshen Pingfei Decoction, a traditional Chinese prescription, on IPF induced by Bleomycin in rats and regulation of TGF-b1/Smad3. AIM OF THE STUDY: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), one of the clinical common diseases, shares similar pathogenesis with ancient disease "Feibi" in Chinese medicine, Renshen pingfei decoction (RPFS), a classical prescription, was commonly used in treating Feibi. In the current study, the protective role of RPFS in rats model of IPF and the mechanism via regulation of TGF-b1/Smad3, were evaluated and explored. METHODS: The chemicals of RPFS were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Under the optimized chromatographic and MS condition, the major components in RPFS were well separated and detected. An IPF model was established in rats which were induced with Bleomycin (BLM). After treated with corresponding medicine for 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days respectively, lung function of rats were measured; peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were assessed; histopathological changes and homogenate of lung tissue were detected; TGF-b1 and Smad3 mRNA and protein expressions in lung tissue were examined as well. RESULTS: 43 signal peaks of chemical components in RPFS were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS method. Compared with model group, RPFS group exerted significant effects on IPF model rats in improving lung function and decreasing HYP content of lung tissue (P<0.01), reducing the level of TGF-b1 and NFkB in BALF (P<0.05), decreasing SOD and MDA level in serum (P<0.01), as well as down-regulating TGF-b1 and Smad3 mRNA and protein expressions of lung tissue (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: RPFS could reduce the lung injury and fibrosis degree and improve lung function of IPF model rats. The protective role might mediated by down-regulating TGF-b1/Smad3 signaling pathway.
