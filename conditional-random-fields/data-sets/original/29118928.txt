MiR-5100 targets TOB2 to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated with activating smad2/3 in lung epithelial cells. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease and the pathogenesis of IPF remains unclear. Our previous study indicated that miR-5100 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of lung epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of miR-5100 on bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse lung fibrosis and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b1) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced EMT-model in A549 and Beas-2B cells. The elevated level of miR-5100 was observed in both the mouse lung fibrosis tissues and EMT cell model. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of miR-5100 promoted the EMT-related changes, enhanced TGF-b1 or EGF-induced EMT and activated the smad2/3 in lung epithelial cells, while silencing miR-5100 had the converse effects. In addition, transwell assay showed that miR-5100 can enhance cell migration. Using target prediction software and luciferase reporter assays, we identified TOB2 as a specific target of miR-5100 and miR-5100 can decrease the accumulation of endogenous TOB2 in A549 and Beas-2B cells. Moreover, the exogenous expression of TOB2 relieves the promotion of miR-5100 on EMT process and migration ability. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-5100 promotes the EMT process by targeting TOB2 associated with activating smad2/3 in lung epithlium cells. Our findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of IPF.
