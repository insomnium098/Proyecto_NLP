Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 contributes to phenotype transformation of fibroblasts in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via multiple pathways. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease and considered as a cancer-like disease. The phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor has drawn attention in the pathogenesis of IPF. However, the role of PTEN in phenotypic transformation of lung fibroblasts, particularly in the migratory and invasive phenotype, is still elusive. Our data showed that PTEN expression was markedly reduced in both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts from IPF patients. Furthermore, loss of PTEN led to the transformation of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and increased proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and migration/invasion activities. PTEN deficiency upregulated hyaluronan synthase 2 expression and thereby enhanced the invasion ability of fibroblasts. Cross-talk between PTEN and the transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) pathway and PTEN reduction by hypoxia were observed. These findings suggest that PTEN is implicated in multiple pathways and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IPF.
