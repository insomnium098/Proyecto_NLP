Methylation-mediated BMPER expression in fibroblast activation in vitro and lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease. Although the pathogenesis is poorly understood, evidence suggests that genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may play a key role. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming-growth-factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily and are important regulators in IPF. Here we identified BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) as a key regulator of fibroblast activation. BMPER is a secreted glycoprotein that binds directly to BMPs and may regulate TGF-b/BMP signaling, but its role in lung fibrosis is not clear. BMPER is highly expressed in human IPF lung fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. Demethylation agent 5'-azacytidine decreased BMPER expression in fibroblasts, and attenuated the invasion and migration of IPF lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated reduction of BMPER in the human lung fibroblasts impaired cell migration and invasion. 5'-azacytidine treatment additionally regulated BMPER expression and reduced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. These findings demonstrate that methylation of specific genes in fibroblasts may offer a new therapeutic strategy for IPF by modulating fibroblast activation.
