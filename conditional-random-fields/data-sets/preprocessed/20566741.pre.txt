Inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling reduces virus load and gammaherpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disorder of unknown etiology. Several studies have demonstrated an association between pulmonary infection with a herpesvirus and IPF. Based on those observations, we have developed a mouse model in which interferon (IFN)gammaR(-/-) mice infected intranasally with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) develop lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that viral load was a critical factor for the development of fibrosis. Because nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling is required to efficiently establish gammaherpesvirus, latency we infected IFNgammaR(-/-) mice with a MHV68 virus that expresses a mutant dominant inhibitor of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, called IkappaBalphaM. Striking differences were observed at the onset of the chronic infection, which correlated with a decreased virus load in mice infected with MHV68-IkappaBalphaM compared with mice infected with control MHV68 (MHV68-MR). IFNgammaR(-/-) mice infected with MHV68-IkappaBalphaM lacked vasculitis and fibrosis 15 to 120 days post infection. Inhibition of NF-kappaB in MHV68-infected cells of the lungs diminished the expression of the fibrocyte recruiting chemokines monocyte-chemoattractant-protein-1 (MCP-1) and CXCL12, ameliorated macrophage expression of markers of alternative activation, and failed to increase expression of the integrin alphavbeta6, which is implicated in the activation of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta. Thus, the inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in the infected lung cells of IFNgammaR(-/-) mice reduces virus persistence and ameliorates profibrotic events. Host determinants of latency might therefore represent new therapeutic targets for gammaherpesvirus-associated pulmonary fibrosis.
