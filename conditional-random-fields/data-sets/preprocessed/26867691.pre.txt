WISP1 mediates IL-6-dependent proliferation in primary human lung fibroblasts. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease. IPF is characterized by epithelial cell injury and reprogramming, increases in (myo)fibroblasts, and altered deposition of extracellular matrix. The Wnt1-inducible-signaling-protein-1 (WISP1) is involved in impaired epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we aimed to further investigate WISP1 regulation and function in primary human lung fibroblasts (phLFs). We demonstrate that WISP1 is directly upregulated by Transforming-growth-factor-b1 (TGFb1) and Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) in phLFs, using a luciferase-based reporter system. WISP1 mRNA and protein secretion increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by TGFb1 and TNFa in phLFs, as analysed by qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Notably, WISP1 is required for TGFb1- and TNFa-dependent induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a mechanism that is conserved in IPF phLFs. The siRNA-mediated WISP1 knockdown led to a significant IL-6 reduction after TGFb1 or TNFa stimulation. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated downregulation or antibody-mediated neutralization of WISP1 reduced phLFs proliferation, a process that was in part rescued by IL-6. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that WISP1-induced IL-6 expression contributes to the pro-proliferative effect on fibroblasts, which is likely orchestrated by a variety of profibrotic mediators, including Wnts, TGFb1 and TNFa.
