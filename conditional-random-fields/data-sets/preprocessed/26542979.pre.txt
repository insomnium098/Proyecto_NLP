microRNA-1343 attenuates pathways of fibrosis by targeting the TGF-b receptors. UNASSIGNED: Irreversible respiratory obstruction resulting from progressive airway damage, inflammation and fibrosis is a feature of several chronic respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cytokine transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-b) has a pivotal role in promoting lung fibrosis and is implicated in respiratory disease severity. Here we show that a previously uncharacterized microRNA, miR-1343, reduces the expression of both TGF-b receptor 1 and 2 by directly targeting their 3' UTRs. After TGF-b exposure, elevated intracellular miR-1343 significantly decreases levels of activated TGF-b effector molecules, pSMAD2 and pSMAD3, when compared to a non-targeting control miRNA. As a result, the abundance of fibrotic markers is reduced, cell migration into a scratch wound impaired, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition repressed. Mature miR-1343 is readily detected in human neutrophils and HL-60 cells and is activated in response to stress in A549 lung epithelial cells. miR-1343 may have direct therapeutic applications in fibrotic lung disease.
