The lncRNA H19 Mediates Pulmonary Fibrosis by Regulating the miR-196a/COL1A1 Axis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by lung fibroblasts accumulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Recently, long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators and prognostic markers in several diseases including IPF. In the present study, we found that the expression of H19 was significantly increased in transforming-growth-factor-b (TGF-b)-induced fibroblast proliferation and bleomycin-(BLM) induced lung fibrosis (p   <   0.05). We further demonstrated that H19 was a direct target of miR-196a and was associated with COL1A1 expression by sponging miR-196a. Moreover, downregulation of H19 alleviated fibroblast activation and lung fibrosis, and this effect was blocked by a miR-196a inhibitor. In conclusion, our results suggest that lncRNA H19 has a promotive effect on BLM-induced IPF, and it functions as a molecular sponge of miR-196a, which provides a novel therapeutic target for IPF.
