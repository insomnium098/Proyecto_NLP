Effect of substrate stiffness on pulmonary fibroblast activation by TGF-b. Peptide crosslinkers containing the sequence C-X-CG (X represents various adhesive peptides) were incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel networks with different mechanical properties. Pulmonary fibroblasts (PFs) exhibit increased adhesion to rigid hydrogels modified with X=RGDS, DGEA and IKVAV (0.5 and/or 5 mM) compared with a scrambled control (X=HRPNS). PFs exhibit increased adhesion to softer hydrogels when X=DGEA at low (0.5 mM) peptide concentration. PFs seeded onto hydrogels modified with X=RGDS produce alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (a-SMA), a myofibroblast marker, and form an extensive cytoskeleton with focal adhesions. Decreasing substrate stiffness (achieved through hydrolytic degradation) results in down-regulation of a-SMA expression by PFs. Substrate stiffness increases the sensitivity of PFs to exogenously applied transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-b1); PFs on the most rigid gels (E=900 kPa) express a-SMA when treated with low concentrations of TGF-b1 (1 ng ml(-1)), while those on less rigid gels (E=20-60 kPa) do not. These results demonstrate the importance of both mechanical and chemical cues in studying pulmonary fibroblast activation, and establish PEG hydrogels as a viable material for further study of IPF etiology.
