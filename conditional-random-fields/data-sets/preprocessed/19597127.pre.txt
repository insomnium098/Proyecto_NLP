Transcription factor GATA-6 is expressed in quiescent myofibroblasts in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (histopathology of usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP]) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis. Characteristic features of IPF/UIP include fibroblastic foci, which are patchy lesions of focal, disarranged myofibroblasts. GATA-6 is a transcription factor linked with cell differentiation. Its role in the development of IPF has not previously been investigated. We hypothesized that GATA-6 participates in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in IPF/UIP lungs. The expression patterns of GATA-6, the mesenchymal marker alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA), and markers for proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (caspase-3) were analyzed in human IPF/UIP tissue samples. The effects of GATA-6 overexpression and silencing were studied in cell cultures. The results show that the alpha-SMA-positive fibroblastic foci in IPF/UIP lungs are positive for GATA-6, but negative for Ki67 and caspase-3. Cultured human IPF/UIP fibroblasts expressed GATA-6 mRNA, whereas cells from the normal adult lung did not. In cultured A549 lung epithelial cells, the induction of GATA-6 by transforming-growth-factor-beta1 resulted in simultaneous expression of alpha-SMA and decrease of E-cadherin. The inhibition of GATA-6 expression in fibroblasts showed that GATA-6 mediates the alpha-SMA-inducing signal of transforming-growth-factor-beta1. In conclusion, the hallmark of IPF/UIP histopathology, the fibroblast focus, consists of differentiated, quiescent cells that prominently express GATA-6.
