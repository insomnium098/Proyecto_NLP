N-acetylcysteine downregulation of lysyl-oxidase activity alleviating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease without beneficial therapy, except for lung transplantation. A high oral dose of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) added to prednisone and azathioprine has been found to improve lung function in IPF patients, though the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Based on our previous findings showing elevation of glutathione (GSH) content associated with downregulation of lysyl-oxidase (LOX) activity, which is essential for collagen deposition, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that NAC alleviates IPF by regulating LOX function. METHODS: We firstly analyzed the time course of collagen deposition in lung tissue, hydroxyproline content, LOX activity, GSH levels, and transforming-growth-factor-b(1) (TGF-b(1)) and a-smooth-muscle-actin (a-SMA) expression in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a rat model. Then, we focused our studies on NAC modulation of LOX activity. RESULTS: LOX activity was increased on day 9 and peaked 14 days after BLM administration, while TGF-b(1) protein peaked on day 9. Interestingly, NAC treatment for 14 days from day 0 reversed LOX activity to normal levels and increased GSH levels in the lung of BLM-dosed rats. Consistently, NAC partially attenuated pulmonary fibrosis and inhibited TGF-b(1) and a-SMA expression in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a novel mechanism of NAC alleviating IPF by inhibition of LOX activity via elevation of lung GSH in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The TGF-b(1)/a-SMA pathway may also play an important role in modulation of LOX activity.
