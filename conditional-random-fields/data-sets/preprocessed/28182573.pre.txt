Amplified canonical transforming-growth-factor-b signallingviaheat shock protein 90 in pulmonary fibrosis. Interstitial lung fibroblast activation coupled with extracellular matrix production is a pathological signature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and is governed by transforming growth factor (TGF)-b/Smad signalling. We sought to define the role of heat shock protein (HSP)90 in profibrotic responses in IPF and to determine the therapeutic effects of HSP90 inhibition in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis.We investigated the effects of HSP90 inhibitionin vitroby applying 17-AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) to lung fibroblasts and A549 cells andin vivoby administering 17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) to mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.HSP90 expression was increased in (myo)fibroblasts from fibrotic human and mouse lungs compared with controls. 17-AAG inhibited TGF-b1-induced extracellular matrix production and transdifferentiation of lung fibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of A549 cells. The antifibrotic effects were associated with TGF-b receptor disruption and inhibition of Smad2/3 activation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that HSP90b interacted with TGF-b receptor II and stabilised TGF-b receptors. Furthermore, 17-DMAG improved lung function and decreased fibrosis and matrix metalloproteinase activity in the lungs of bleomycin-challenged mice.In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that HSP90 inhibition blocks pulmonary fibroblast activation and ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.
