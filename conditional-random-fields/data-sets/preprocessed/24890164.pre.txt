Expression of suppressor-of-cytokine-signaling-1 in the peripheral blood of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive diffuse parenchymal disease with a poor prognosis. A variety of cytokines and chemokines are involved in its pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features in IPF patients with the expression of suppressor-of-cytokine-signaling-1 (SOCS-1), which acts as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling. METHODS: IPF patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 16) were included in this study. The expression of SOCS-1 was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of subjects using RT-PCR. Interleukin 4 (IL-4), transforming-growth-factor-b1 (TGF-b1) and type I collagen expression were also analyzed in each individual using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical characteristics of IPF patients were delineated. These results were analyzed by SPSS13.0 statistics software. RESULTS: SOCS-1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the PBMC of IPF patients compared with healthy controls; serum levels of IL-4 and TGF-b1 were higher in IPF patients. The patients with lower expression of SOCS-1 developed lower percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC%) and DLCO/VA. A patients' SOCS-1 mRNA level was negatively correlated with serum levels of IL-4, and negatively correlated with their high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scores. CONCLUSIONS: SOCS-1 mRNA can be detected in PBMC, and it is down-regulated in IPF patients. The expression of SOCS-1 is associated with the severity of IPF patients' symptoms, so it might be the predictor of disease severity. SOCS-1 might play an important role in IPF by reducing the expression of the T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-related cytokine IL-4.
