Ambroxol hydrochloride in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Clinical trials are the need of the hour. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating lung disease of unknown etiology. Its pathogenesis remains poorly elucidated but aberrant wound healing is central to its pathology. It has a median survival time of 3 to 5 years. None of the treatment modality or drugs tried in its management has so far changed the overall outcome. Recent in vitro and experimental studies have shown that ambroxol hydrochloride exerts several newer actions, namely the surfactant stimulatory, anti-imflammatory and anti-oxidant actions, in addition to its being a secrrtolytic and mucokinetic agent. The anti inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of the drug are due to its ability to block the release of oxidant stress markers, cytokines, leukotrienes, MPO activity, hydroxyproline content, nitic oxide and/or collagen I _ III mRNA in the local milieu while preserving the SOD and GSH-PX activities. In human studies also, the agent was able to block the expression of TGF-beta and TNF-alpha in plasma and preserving the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of the lungs in lung cancer patients on radiation therapy. Thus, ambroxol may have the potential to check the dysregulated healing process that is typical of IPF. This, coupled with its safety profile for human use, warrants clinical trials of the drug in the management of IPF.
