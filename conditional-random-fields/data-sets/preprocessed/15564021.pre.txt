Medical treatment for pulmonary fibrosis: current trends, concepts, and prospects. A diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) carries a poor prognosis, with our currently available therapies offering little clinical benefit. Unfortunately, recent major advances in our understanding of the clinical and biologic features of this disease have not been matched by similar advances in treatment. This is likely because of the complex cascade of biologic and pathobiologic events that occurs in IPF. The necessary, and desperately needed, next generation of therapies, focused on specific molecular targets thought to play pivotal roles in the development and progression of fibrosis, are under active investigation.
