Semaphorin-7a+ regulatory T cells are associated with progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and are implicated in transforming-growth-factor-b1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. RATIONALE: Lymphocytes are increasingly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Semaphorin-7a (Sema-7a) participates in lymphocyte activation. OBJECTIVES: To define the relationship between Sema-7a and lymphocytes in IPF. METHODS: We characterized the significance of Sema-7a+ lymphocytes in humans with IPF and in a mouse model of lung fibrosis caused by lung-targeted, transgenic overexpression of TGF-b1. We determined the site of Sema-7a expression in human and murine lungs and circulation and used adoptive transfer approaches to define the relevance of lymphocytes coexpressing Sema7a and the markers CD19, CD4, or CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ in TGF-b1-induced murine lung fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Subjects with IPF show expression of Sema-7a on lung CD4+ cells and circulating CD4+ or CD19+ cells. Sema-7a expression is increased on CD4+ cells and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, but not CD19+ cells, in subjects with progressive IPF. Sema-7a is expressed on lymphocytes expressing CD4 but not CD19 in the lungs and spleen of TGF-b1-transgenic mice. Sema-7a expressing bone marrow-derived cells induce lung fibrosis and alter the production of T-cell mediators, including IFN-y, IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-10. These effects require CD4 but not CD19. In comparison to Sema-7a-CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells, Sema7a+CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells exhibit reduced expression of regulatory genes such as IL-10, and adoptive transfer of these cells induces fibrosis and remodeling in the TGF-b1-exposed murine lung. CONCLUSIONS: Sema-7a+CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells are associated with disease progression in subjects with IPF and induce fibrosis in the TGF-b1-exposed murine lung.
