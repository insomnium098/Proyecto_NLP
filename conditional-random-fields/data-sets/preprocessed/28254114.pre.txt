Genetic polymorphism in matrix-metalloproteinase-9 and transforming-growth-factor-b1 and susceptibility to combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema in  a Chinese population. In this study, we aimed to explore the association of genetic polymorphism in matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and transforming-growth-factor-b1 (TGF-b1) and the susceptibility to combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). We examined the polymorphisms of the MMP-9 C-1562T and TGF-b1 T869C in 38 CPFE patients, 50 pulmonary emphysema patients, and 34 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. The frequencies of polymorphic genotypes in MMP-9 were 78.95% CC and 21.05% CT in CPFE group, 76.0% CC and 24.0% CT in emphysema group, and 100.0% CC in IPF group. There were highly statistically significant increased frequencies of the CT genotype and T allele in CPFE and emphysema groups compared with IPF group (p < 0.05). The frequencies of polymorphic genotypes in TGF-b1 were 2.63% CC, 28.95% CT, 68.42% TT in CPFE group, 4.00% CC, 16.00% CT, 80.00% TT in emphysema group, and 5.88% CC, 41.18% CT, 52.94% TT in IPF group. Significant increases in the TT genotype and T allele frequencies were observed in emphysema group compared with IPF group (p < 0.05). Our study has showed that T allele in MMP-9 (C-1562T) and T allele in TGF-b1 (T869C) are risk factors of pulmonary emphysema. The T allele in MMP-9 (C-1562T) possibly predisposes patients with pulmonary fibrosis to develop emphysema.
