Aortic-carboxypeptidase-like-protein (ACLP) enhances lung myofibroblast differentiation through transforming-growth-factor-b receptor-dependent and -independent pathways. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal lung disease characterized by the overgrowth, hardening, and scarring of lung tissue. The exact mechanisms of how IPF develops and progresses are unknown. IPF is characterized by extracellular matrix remodeling and accumulation of active TGFb, which promotes collagen expression and the differentiation of smooth-muscle-a-actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. Aortic-carboxypeptidase-like-protein (ACLP) is an extracellular matrix protein secreted by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and is expressed in fibrotic human lung tissue and in mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Importantly, ACLP knockout mice are significantly protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. The goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms of ACLP action on fibroblast differentiation. As primary lung fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, ACLP expression preceded SMA and collagen expression. Recombinant ACLP induced SMA and collagen expression in mouse and human lung fibroblasts. Knockdown of ACLP slowed the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and partially reverted differentiated myofibroblasts by reducing SMA expression. We hypothesized that ACLP stimulates myofibroblast formation partly through activating TGFb signaling. Treatment of fibroblasts with recombinant ACLP induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3. This phosphorylation and induction of SMA was dependent on TGFb receptor binding and kinase activity. ACLP-induced collagen expression was independent of interaction with the TGFb receptor. These findings indicate that ACLP stimulates the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by promoting SMA expression via TGFb signaling and promoting collagen expression through a TGFb receptor-independent pathway.
