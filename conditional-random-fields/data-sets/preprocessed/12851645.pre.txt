Significant involvement of CCL2 (MCP-1) in inflammatory disorders of the lung. Mounting evidence suggests that CCL2 (MCP-1) and its hematopoietic cell receptor CC-chemokine-receptor-2 (CCR2) are involved in inflammatory disorders of the lung. In animal models of allergic asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), CCL2 expression and protein production are increased and the disease process is attenuated by CCL2 immunoneutralization. Mechanisms by which CCL2 may be acting include recruitment of regulatory and effector leukocytes; stimulation of histamine or leukotriene release from mast cells or basophils; induction of fibroblast production of transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) and procollagen; and enhancement of Th2 polarization. Recently, polymorphism for CCL2 has been described with increased cytokine-induced release of CCL2 by monocytes and increased risk of allergic asthma. These studies identify potentially important roles for CCL2 in these lung inflammatory disorders. While CCL2 inhibition in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be hazardous by interfering with defense against bacteremia, future studies are needed to determine if CCL2/CCR2 antagonism will offer breakthrough therapy for patients with allergic asthma, IPF, or BOS, and to confirm the hypothesis that CCL2 polymorphism places patients at greater risk for these disorders.
