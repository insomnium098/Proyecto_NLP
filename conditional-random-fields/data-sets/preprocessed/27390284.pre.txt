Age-driven developmental drift in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. UNASSIGNED: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal disease of unknown aetiology. A growing body of evidence supports that IPF represents an epithelial-driven process characterised by aberrant epithelial cell behaviour, fibroblast/myofibroblast activation and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix with the subsequent destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms involved in the abnormal hyper-activation of the epithelium are unclear, but we propose that recapitulation of pathways and processes critical to embryological development associated with a tissue specific age-related stochastic epigenetic drift may be implicated. These pathways may also contribute to the distinctive behaviour of IPF fibroblasts. Genomic and epigenomic studies have revealed that wingless/Int, sonic hedgehog and other developmental signalling pathways are reactivated and deregulated in IPF. Moreover, some of these pathways cross-talk with transforming-growth-factor-b activating a profibrotic feedback loop. The expression pattern of microRNAs is also dysregulated in IPF and exhibits a similar expression profile to embryonic lungs. In addition, senescence, a process usually associated with ageing, which occurs early in alveolar epithelial cells of IPF lungs, likely represents a conserved programmed developmental mechanism. Here, we review the major developmental pathways that get twisted in IPF, and discuss the connection with ageing and potential therapeutic approaches.
