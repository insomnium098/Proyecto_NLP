Epithelium-specific deletion of TGF-b receptor type II protects mice from bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibroproliferative pulmonary disorder for which there are currently no treatments. Although the etiology of IPF is unknown, dysregulated TGF-b signaling has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Recent studies also suggest a central role for abnormal epithelial repair. In this study, we sought to elucidate the function of epithelial TGF-b signaling via TGF-b receptor II (TbRII) and its contribution to fibrosis by generating mice in which TbRII was specifically inactivated in mouse lung epithelium. These mice, which are referred to herein as TbRIINkx2.1-cre mice, were used to determine the impact of TbRII inactivation on (a) embryonic lung morphogenesis in vivo; and (b) the epithelial cell response to TGF-b signaling in vitro and in a bleomycin-induced, TGF-b-mediated mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. Although postnatally viable with no discernible abnormalities in lung morphogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation, TbRIINkx2.1-cre mice developed emphysema, suggesting a requirement for epithelial TbRII in alveolar homeostasis. Absence of TbRII increased phosphorylation of Smad2 and decreased, but did not entirely block, phosphorylation of Smad3 in response to endogenous/physiologic TGF-b. However, TbRIINkx2.1-cre mice exhibited increased survival and resistance to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to demonstrate a specific role for TGF-b signaling in the lung epithelium in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.
