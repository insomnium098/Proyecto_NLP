TGF-beta-1 as an enhancer of Fas-mediated apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. Transforming-growth-factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) has important roles in lung fibrosis and the potential to induce apoptosis in several types of cells. We previously demonstrated that apoptosis of lung epithelial cells induced by Fas ligation may be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we show that TGF-beta1 induces apoptosis of primary cultured bronchiolar epithelial cells via caspase-3 activation and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Concentrations of TGF-beta-1 that were not sufficient to induce apoptosis alone could enhance agonistic anti-Fas Ab or rFas-ligand-mediated apoptosis of cultured bronchiolar epithelial cells. Soluble Fas-ligand in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) also induced apoptosis of cultured bronchiolar epithelial cells that was significantly attenuated by anti-TGF-beta Ab. Otherwise, BALF from patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) could not induce apoptosis on bronchiolar epithelial cells, despite its comparable amounts of soluble Fas-ligand. The concentrations of TGF-beta-1 in BALF from patients with IPF were significantly higher compared with those in BALF from patients with HP or controls. Furthermore, coincubation with the low concentration of TGF-beta-1 and HP BALF created proapoptotic effects comparable with the IPF BALF. In vivo, the administration of TGF-beta-1 could enhance Fas-mediated epithelial cell apoptosis and lung injury via caspase-3 activation in mice. Our results demonstrate a novel role of TGF-beta-1 in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis as an enhancer of Fas-mediated apoptosis of lung epithelial cells.
