BACKGROUND	NN

Idiopathic	JJ

A	DT

OBJECTIVE	NN
:	:
Based	VBN

our	PRP$

which	WDT

essential	JJ
for	IN

the	DT
aim	NN
of	IN
the	DT
present	JJ
study	NN
was	VBD

the	DT

that	IN

METHODS	NNS

We	PRP

Then	RB

we	PRP
focused	VBD
our	PRP$

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
LOX	NN
activity	NN
was	VBD
increased	VBN
on	IN

9	CD

peaked	VBD
14	CD

while	IN
TGF-b	NN

Interestingly	RB

Consistently	RB

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

Our	PRP$
