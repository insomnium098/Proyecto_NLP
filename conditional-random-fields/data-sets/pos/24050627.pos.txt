Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
is	VBZ
a	DT
fibrosing	JJ
interstitial	JJ
lung	NN
disease	NN
associated	VBN
with	IN
aging	NN
that	WDT
is	VBZ
characterized	VBN
by	IN
the	DT
histopathological	JJ
pattern	NN
of	IN
usual	JJ
interstitial	JJ
pneumonia	NN

Although	IN
an	DT
understanding	NN
of	IN
the	DT
pathogenesis	NN
of	IN
IPF	NN
is	VBZ
incomplete	JJ

recent	JJ
advances	NNS
delineating	VBG

pathologic	JJ
features	NNS
of	IN
IPF	NN
have	VBP
led	VBN
to	TO
better	JJR
definition	NN
of	IN
the	DT
molecular	JJ

that	WDT
are	VBP
pathologically	RB

In	IN
this	DT
