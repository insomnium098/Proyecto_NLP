BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(

AIM	NN
:	:
To	TO
determine	VB
the	DT

of	IN
nintedanib	NN
on	IN
primary	JJ
human	JJ

METHODS	NNS
:	:
Fibroblasts	NNS
were	VBD
isolated	VBN
from	IN
lungs	NNS
of	IN
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
and	CC
from	IN
non-fibrotic	JJ

We	PRP
assessed	VBD

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
expressed	VBD
higher	JJR
levels	NNS
of	IN
PDGFR	NN
and	CC
FGFR	NN
than	IN
controls	NNS
.	.

PDGF-BB	NN
,	,
bFGF	NN
,	,
and	CC
VEGF	NN
caused	VBD
a	DT
pro-proliferative	JJ
effect	NN
which	WDT
was	VBD
prevented	VBN
by	IN
nintedanib	NN
.	.

Nintedanib	NN
enhanced	VBD
the	DT
expression	NN
of	IN
pro-MMP-2	NN
,	,
and	CC
inhibited	VBD
the	DT
expression	NN
of	IN
TIMP-2	NN
.	.

Transforming-growth-factor-beta-induced	JJ
secretion	NN
of	IN
collagens	NNS
was	VBD
inhibited	VBN
by	IN
nintedanib	NN
.	.

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
Our	PRP$
data	NNS
demonstrate	VBP
a	DT
significant	JJ
anti-fibrotic	JJ
effect	NN
of	IN
nintedanib	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN
