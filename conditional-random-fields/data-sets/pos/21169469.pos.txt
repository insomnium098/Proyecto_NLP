The	DT

The	DT

plays	VBZ
a	DT

the	DT

OBJECTIVES	NNS

To	TO
elucidate	VB
the	DT

which	WDT
YY1	NN

METHODS	NNS

Lung	NN

Lung	NN

up-regulated	VBD
YY1	NN

TGF-b-induced	JJ
YY1	NN

was	VBD
dramatically	RB
decreased	VBN
by	IN
an	DT
inhibitor	NN
of	IN
NF-kB	NN

YY1	NN
is	VBZ
significantly	RB
overexpressed	VBN
in	IN
both	CC
human	JJ
IPF	NN

murine	JJ
models	NNS
of	IN

Furthermore	RB
,	,
the	DT
mechanism	NN
of	IN
fibrogenesis	NN
is	VBZ
that	IN
YY1	NN
can	MD
up-regulate	VB
a-SMA	NN

YY1-deficient	JJ
(	(
YY1	NN

mice	NNS
were	VBD
significantly	RB
protected	VBN
from	IN

,	,
which	WDT
was	VBD
associated	VBN

Finally	RB
,	,
decreasing	VBG
YY1	NN
expression	NN
through	IN

adenovirus-cre	JJ
in	IN
floxed-YY1	NN
(	(

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

YY1	NN
is	VBZ

Decreasing	VBG
