To	TO

no	DT

these	DT

METHODS	NNS
:	:
Here	RB
,	,
we	PRP
used	VBD
biochemical	JJ

cell	NN
biological	JJ
and	CC
preclinical	JJ
studies	NNS
to	TO
evaluate	VB

of	IN

and	CC

.	.

In	IN
our	PRP$
in	FW

studies	NNS
,	,
we	PRP
exposed	VBD
primary	JJ
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
,	,
epithelial	JJ
and	CC
endothelial	JJ
cells	NNS
to	TO
ionizing	VBG
radiation	NN
or	CC
bleomycin	NN
;	:
stimuli	NNS
typically	RB
used	VBN
to	TO
induce	VB
inflammation	NN
and	CC

In	IN
addition	NN
,	,
we	PRP
cultured	VBD
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
from	IN
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
and	CC
studied	VBD
the	DT

of	IN
esomeprazole	NN

Our	PRP$
preclinical	JJ
study	NN
tested	VBN
efficacy	NN
of	IN
esomeprazole	NN
in	IN
a	DT
rat	NN
model	NN
of	IN
bleomycin-induced	JJ
lung	NN

.	.

Furthermore	RB
,	,
we	PRP
performed	VBD
retrospective	JJ
analysis	NN
of	IN
interstitial	JJ
lung	NN
disease	NN
(	(
ILD	NN
)	)
databases	NNS
to	TO
examine	VB
the	DT

of	IN
PPIs	NNS
on	IN
transplant-free	JJ

.	.

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
The	DT
cell	NN
culture	NN
studies	NNS
revealed	VBD
that	IN
esomeprazole	NN
controls	NNS
inflammation	NN
by	IN
suppressing	VBG
the	DT
expression	NN
of	IN
pro-inflammatory	JJ
molecules	NNS
including	VBG
vascular	JJ
cell	NN

molecule-1	NN
,	,
inducible	JJ
nitric	JJ
oxide	NN

,	,
tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha	NN
(	(
TNF-a	NN
)	)
and	CC
interleukins	NNS
(	(
IL-1b	NN
and	CC
IL-6	NN
)	)
.	.

The	DT
antioxidant	JJ
effect	NN
is	VBZ
associated	VBN
with	IN
strong	JJ
induction	NN
of	IN
the	DT
stress-inducible	JJ
cytoprotective	JJ
protein	NN
heme-oxygenase-1	NN
(	(
HO1	NN
)	)
and	CC
the	DT
antifibrotic	JJ
effect	NN
is	VBZ
associated	VBN
with	IN
potent	JJ
inhibition	NN
of	IN
fibroblast	NN
proliferation	NN
as	RB
well	RB
as	IN
downregulation	NN
of	IN
profibrotic	JJ
proteins	NNS
including	VBG
receptors	NNS
for	IN
transforming-growth-factor-b	NN
(	(
TGFb	NN
)	)
,	,
fibronectin	NN
and	CC
matrix	NN
metalloproteinases	NNS
(	(
MMPs	NNS
)	)
.	.

Furthermore	RB
,	,
esomeprazole	NN
showed	VBD
robust	JJ

in	IN

the	DT
inflammatory	JJ
and	CC
fibrotic	JJ
responses	NNS
in	IN
a	DT
murine	JJ

of	IN
acute	JJ

.	.

Finally	RB
,	,
retrospective	JJ
analysis	NN
of	IN
two	CD
ILD	NNP
databases	NNS
was	VBD
performed	VBN
to	TO
assess	VB
the	DT
effect	NN
of	IN
PPIs	NNS
on	IN
transplant-free	JJ
survival	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
.	.

Intriguingly	RB
,	,
this	DT
data	NNS
demonstrated	VBD
that	IN
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
on	IN
PPIs	NNS
had	VBD
prolonged	VBN
survival	NN
over	IN
controls	NNS
(	(
median	JJ

of	IN
3.4	CD
vs	CC
2	CD

.	.

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
Overall	JJ
,	,
these	DT
data	NNS
indicate	VBP
the	DT
possibility	NN
that	IN
PPIs	NNS
may	MD
