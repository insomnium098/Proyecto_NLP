INTRODUCTION	NN

Idiopathic	JJ

fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

is	VBZ
a	DT

with	IN
an	DT

only	RB

The	DT
mechanisms	NNS
underlying	VBG
the	DT

are	VBP

Interestingly	RB

the	DT

the	DT

is	VBZ

The	DT
authors	NNS
hypothesized	VBD
that	IN

METHODS	NNS

Young	NNP

were	VBD

In	IN

Lung	NN

RESULTS	NNS

The	DT
lungs	NNS

old	JJ
mice	NNS
showed	VBD

At	IN
