Accumulation	NNP

Metformin	NNP
is	VBZ
a	DT
biguanide	NN
antidiabetic	JJ
medication	NN
and	CC
its	PRP$
pharmacological	JJ
action	NN
is	VBZ
mediated	VBN
through	IN
the	DT

of	IN
AMP-activated	JJ
protein	NN
kinase	NN
(	(
AMPK	NN

,	,
which	WDT

not	RB

Therefore	RB

we	PRP
sought	VBD

the	DT

METHODS	NNS

TGF-b-induced	JJ
myofibroblast	NN

The	DT

RESULTS	NNS

We	PRP

myofibroblast	NN

was	VBD
clearly	RB

Metformin-mediated	JJ
activation	NN

NOX4	NN

BLM	NN

concomitantly	RB

which	WDT

Increased	VBN

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

These	DT
