Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ

is	VBZ
a	DT
progressive	JJ

Caveolin-1	NN
(	(

,	,
a	DT
principal	JJ
component	NN

caveolae	FW

has	VBZ

the	DT

We	PRP
observed	VBD

in	IN
primary	JJ

We	PRP

Additionally	RB

transforming-growth-factor-beta1	NN
(	(
TGF-beta1	NN

the	DT

cav-1	NN

Interestingly	RB

Moreover	RB

JNK1-null	JJ

This	DT
