To	TO
determine	VB
the	DT

METHODS	NNS
:	:
The	DT

between	IN
wild-type	JJ

examined	VBN
in	IN
formalin-fixed	JJ
human	JJ

MAIN	NNS
RESULTS	NNS
:	:
TG2	NN
knockout	NN
mice	NNS
developed	VBD
significantly	RB
reduced	VBN
fibrosis	NN

In	FW

overexpression	NN
of	IN
TG2	NN
led	VBD
to	TO
increased	VBN
fibronectin	NN

whereas	IN
transglutaminase	NN
knockdown	NN
led	VBD
to	TO

The	DT
profibrotic	JJ

transforming-growth-factor-b	NN
causes	VBZ
an	DT

in	IN
membrane-localized	JJ

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
TG2	NN
is	VBZ
involved	VBN
in	IN
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
in	IN
a	DT
mouse	NN
model	NN
and	CC
in	IN
human	JJ

and	CC
is	VBZ

With	IN
continued	VBN
