BACKGROUND	NN

Pirfenidone	NN
(	(
PFD	NN

is	VBZ
an	DT
anti-fibrotic	JJ
agent	NN
used	VBN
to	TO
treat	VB
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

,	,
but	CC
its	PRP$
precise	JJ
mechanism	NN
of	IN
action	NN
remains	VBZ
elusive	JJ

Accumulation	NNP
of	IN
profibrotic	JJ
myofibroblasts	NNS
is	VBZ
a	DT
crucial	JJ
process	NN
for	IN
fibrotic	JJ
remodeling	NN
in	IN

Recent	JJ
findings	NNS
show	VBP
participation	NN

Mitophagy	NNP
has	VBZ

implicated	VBN
in	IN
myofibroblast	NN
differentiation	NN
through	IN
regulating	VBG

In	IN

the	DT

PFD	NN
on	IN
autophagy/mitophagy	JJ
activation	NN
in	IN
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
(	(

was	VBD

specifically	RB
the	DT

METHODS	NNS

Transforming-growth-factor-b	NN

The	DT
anti-fibrotic	JJ
role	NN
of	IN
PFD	NN
was	VBD
examined	VBN

bleomycin	NN

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
We	PRP
found	VBD
that	IN
PFD	NN

enhanced	VBN
PARK2	NN

PFD	NN

BLM-treated	JJ

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

These	DT

suggest	VBP
that	IN
PFD	NN
