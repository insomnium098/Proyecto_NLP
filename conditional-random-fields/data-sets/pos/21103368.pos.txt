BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

is	VBZ
a	DT
progressive	JJ
and	CC
fatal	JJ
illness	NN
whose	WP$
pathogenesis	NN
remains	VBZ
poorly	RB
understood	VBN

Recent	JJ

oxidative	JJ

as	IN
a	DT
key	JJ
player	NN
in	IN
the	DT
establishment/progression	NN
of	IN
lung	NN

in	IN
animal	NN
models	NNS
and	CC
possibly	RB
in	IN
human	JJ
IPF	NN

The	DT
aim	NN
of	IN
the	DT
present	JJ
study	NN
was	VBD
to	TO
characterize	VB
the	DT
cellular	JJ

of	IN
fibroblasts	NNS

IPF	NN

and	CC

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL	NN
FINDINGS	NNS
:	:
We	PRP
first	RB
analyzed	VBD
the	DT
baseline	NN
differentiation	NN
features	NNS
and	CC
growth	NN

of	IN
primary	JJ
lung	NN

Then	RB
,	,
we	PRP
focused	VBD
on	IN
the	DT
redox	NN
state	NN
and	CC
related	JJ
molecular	JJ
pathways	NNS
of	IN
IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
and	CC
investigated	VBD
the	DT
impact	NN
of	IN
oxidative	JJ
stress	NN
in	IN
the	DT
establishment	NN
of	IN
the	DT
IPF	NN
phenotype	NN
.	.

IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
were	VBD
differentiated	VBN
into	IN
alpha-smooth-muscle-actin	NN
(	(
SMA	NN
)	)
-	:
positive	JJ
myofibroblasts	NNS
,	,
displayed	VBD
a	DT
pro-fibrotic	JJ
phenotype	NN
as	IN
expressing	VBG
type-I	NN
collagen	NN
,	,
and	CC
proliferated	VBD
lower	JJR
than	IN
controls	NNS
cells	NNS
.	.

The	DT
IPF	NN
phenotype	NN
was	VBD
inducible	JJ
upon	IN
oxidative	JJ
stress	NN
in	IN
control	NN
cells	NNS
and	CC
was	VBD
sensitive	JJ
to	TO
ROS	NN

.	.

IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
also	RB
contained	VBD
large	JJ
excess	NN
of	IN
reactive	JJ
oxygen	NN
species	NNS
(	(
ROS	NN
)	)
due	JJ
to	TO
the	DT
activation	NN
of	IN
an	DT
NADPH	NN
oxidase-like	JJ
system	NN
,	,
displayed	VBD
higher	JJR
levels	NNS
of	IN
tyrosine	NN
phosphorylated	JJ
proteins	NNS
and	CC
were	VBD
more	RBR
resistant	JJ
to	TO
oxidative-stress	NN
induced	VBD
cell	NN
death	NN
.	.

Interestingly	RB
,	,
the	DT
IPF	NN
traits	NNS
disappeared	VBD
with	IN
time	NN
in	IN
culture	NN
,	,
indicating	VBG
a	DT
transient	JJ
effect	NN
of	IN
the	DT
initial	JJ

.	.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE	NNP
:	:
Robust	JJ
expression	NN
of	IN
a-SMA	NN
and	CC
type-I	NN
collagen	NN
,	,
high	JJ
and	CC
uniformly-distributed	JJ
ROS	NN
levels	NNS
,	,
resistance	NN
to	TO
oxidative-stress	NN
induced	VBD
cell	NN
death	NN
and	CC
constitutive	JJ
activation	NN
of	IN
tyrosine	NN
kinase	NN
(	(

)	)
signalling	NN
are	VBP
distinctive	JJ
features	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
IPF	NN
phenotype	NN
.	.

We	PRP
suggest	VBP
that	IN
this	DT
phenotype	NN
can	MD
be	VB
used	VBN
as	IN
a	DT
model	NN
to	TO
identify	VB
the	DT
