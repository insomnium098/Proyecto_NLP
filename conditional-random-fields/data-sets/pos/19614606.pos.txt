IPF	NN

is	VBZ
a	DT
chronic	JJ

IPF	NN
is	VBZ

Recent	JJ

lung	NN
epithelium	NN
plays	VBZ
a	DT
key	JJ
role	NN
in	IN
driving	VBG
the	DT

The	DT
current	JJ
paradigm	NN
suggests	VBZ
that	IN

after	IN

there	EX
is	VBZ
impaired	JJ

This	DT

Furthermore	RB

fibroblasts	NNS

There	EX

In	IN

TGFbeta	NN

Owing	VBG

the	DT

Therefore	RB
the	DT
