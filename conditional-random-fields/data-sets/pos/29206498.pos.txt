In	IN
this	DT

MATERIALS	NNS
AND	CC
METHODS	NNS
:	:
Apigenin	NN
was	VBD
employed	VBN
to	TO
treat	VB
IPF	NNP
in	IN
a	DT
bleomycin-induced	JJ
PF	NN
rat	NN

Apigenin	NN
was	VBD
loaded	VBN
onto	IN
a	DT
biodegradable	JJ
polymer	NN
carrier	NN
(	(

to	TO
improve	VB
its	PRP$
bio-solubility	NN

The	DT
properties	NNS
(	(

)	)
of	IN
the	DT
apigenin	NN

were	VBD
well-characterized	JJ

In	FW

study	NN
was	VBD
performed	VBN

assess	VB
the	DT

as	RB
well	RB
as	IN
inflammatory	JJ

The	DT
impact	NN
of	IN
apigenin	NN
on	IN
the	DT
production	NN
of	IN
inflammatory	JJ
cytokines	NNS
(	(
e.g.	FW

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Our	PRP$
results	NNS
showed	VBD

And	CC
compared	VBN
with	IN
apigenin	NN
in	IN

apigenin	NN
is	VBZ
more	RBR

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
Our	PRP$

suggested	VBD
that	IN
