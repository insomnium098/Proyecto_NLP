BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
is	VBZ
a	DT
treatment	NN
resistant	JJ
disease	NN
with	IN
poor	JJ
prognosis	NN
.	.

Numerous	JJ
compounds	NNS
have	VBP
been	VBN
demonstrated	VBN
to	TO
efficiently	RB
prevent	VB
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
PF	NN
)	)
in	IN
animal	NN
models	NNS
but	CC
only	RB
a	DT
few	JJ
were	VBD
successful	JJ
when	WRB
given	VBN
to	TO
animals	NNS
with	IN
established	JJ
fibrosis	NN
.	.

Major	JJ
concerns	NNS
of	IN
current	JJ
PF	NN
models	NNS
are	VBP
spontaneous	JJ
resolution	NN
and	CC
high	JJ
variability	NN
of	IN
fibrosis	NN
,	,
and	CC
the	DT
lack	NN
of	IN
assessment	NN
methods	NNS
that	WDT
can	MD

to	TO
monitor	VB
the	DT
effect	NN
of	IN
drugs	NNS
in	IN
individual	JJ
animals	NNS
over	IN
time	NN

We	PRP
used	VBD
a	DT
model	NN
of	IN
experimental	JJ
PF	NN
in	IN
rats	NNS
and	CC
compare	VB
parameters	NNS
obtained	VBN
in	IN

animals	NNS
with	IN
conventional	JJ

tools	NNS
that	WDT
require	VBP
removal	NN
of	IN
the	DT
lungs	NNS

METHODS	NNS
:	:
PF	NN
was	VBD
induced	VBN
in	IN
rats	NNS
by	IN
adenoviral	JJ
gene	NN
transfer	NN
of	IN
transforming-growth-factor-beta	NN
.	.

Morphological	JJ
and	CC
functional	JJ
changes	NNS
were	VBD
assessed	VBN
for	IN
up	RB
to	TO
56	CD
days	NNS
by	IN
micro-CT	NN
,	,
lung	NN
compliance	NN
(	(
measured	VBN
via	IN
a	DT
mechanical	JJ
ventilator	NN
)	)
and	CC
VO2max	NN
and	CC
compared	VBN
to	TO
histomorphometry	NN
and	CC
hydroxyproline	NN
content	NN
.	.

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Standard	NNP
histological	JJ
and	CC
collagen	NN
assessment	NN
confirmed	VBD
the	DT
persistent	JJ
fibrotic	JJ
phenotype	NN
as	IN
described	VBN
before	IN
.	.

The	DT
histomorphological	JJ
scores	NNS
correlated	VBD
both	DT
to	TO
radiological	JJ
(	(
r2	NN
=	JJ
0.29	CD

p	NN
<	JJR
0.01	CD
)	)
and	CC
functional	JJ
changes	NNS
(	(
r2	NN

0.51	CD

p	NN
<	JJR
0.0001	CD
)	)

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
The	DT
progression	NN
of	IN
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
can	MD
be	VB
reliably	RB
assessed	VBN
and	CC
followed	VBN
in	IN
living	VBG
animals	NNS
over	IN

using	VBG

This	DT
approach	NN
directly	RB
translates	VBZ
to	TO
the	DT
management	NN
of	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
and	CC
allows	VBZ
