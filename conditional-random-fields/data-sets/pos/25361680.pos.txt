BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Activins	NNS
are	VBP
members	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
TGF	NN

superfamily	NN
of	IN

factors	NNS
.	.

First	RB
,	,
we	PRP
identified	VBD
by	IN
expression	NN
array	NN

that	WDT
activin-B	NN
and	CC
follistatin	NN
are	VBP
upregulated	VBN
in	IN
human	JJ
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ

(	(
IPF	NN

Next	RB

we	PRP

their	PRP$

METHODS	NNS
:	:
We	PRP
used	VBD
specific	JJ
antibodies	NNS
for	IN
activin-A	NN
and	CC
-	:
B	NN
subunits	NNS
and	CC
follistatin	NN
to	TO
measure	VB

localize	VB
their	PRP$
levels	NNS
in	IN
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ

and	CC
control	NN
lung	NN
biopsies	NNS

To	TO
inhibit	VB
activin	NN

,	,
we	PRP
used	VBD
soluble	JJ
activin	NN
type	NN
IIB	NN
receptor	NN
fused	VBN

the	DT

in	IN
two	CD

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Activin-B	NN
and	CC
follistatin	NN
mRNA	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
elevated	JJ
in	IN

Mice	NNS

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
The	DT
upregulation	NN
of	IN
activin-B	NN
and	CC
follistatin	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
novel	JJ

Our	PRP$
results	NNS
indicate	VBP
that	IN
activin	NN
inhibition	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
an	DT
efficient	JJ
tool	NN
for	IN
antifibrotic	JJ

but	CC
could	MD
be	VB
useful	JJ
in	IN
reducing	VBG

Activin-B	NN
