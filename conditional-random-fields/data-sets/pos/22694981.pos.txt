BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Pirfenidone	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
novel	JJ
anti-fibrotic	JJ
and	CC
anti-inflammatory	JJ
agent	NN
that	WDT
inhibits	VBZ
the	DT

of	IN

in	IN
animal	NN
models	NNS
and	CC
in	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

We	PRP

pirfenidone	NN
inhibits	VBZ
the	DT

The	DT

pneumocytes	NNS

The	DT

evaluates	VBZ

METHODS	NNS
:	:
The	DT

E-cadherin	NN
mRNAs	NNS

The	DT

RESULTS	NNS

TGF-b1	NN

pirfenidone	NN

Pirfenidone	NNP
also	RB
inhibited	VBD

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
We	PRP
concluded	VBD
that	IN
the	DT
anti-fibrotic	JJ
effects	NNS
of	IN
pirfenidone	NN
might	MD
be	VB
mediated	VBN
not	RB
only	RB
through	IN
the	DT

but	CC
also	RB
through	IN
the	DT

of	IN

in	IN
alveolar	JJ

cells	NNS
,	,
which	WDT

Furthermore	RB

pirfenidone	NN
