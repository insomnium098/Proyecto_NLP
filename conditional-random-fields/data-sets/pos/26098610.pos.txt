In	IN

OBJECTIVES	NNS

In	IN
this	DT

the	DT
putative	JJ
anti-proliferative	JJ

anti-fibrogenic	JJ
effects	NNS
of	IN
Tb4	NN

were	VBD

In	IN

METHODS	NNS

We	PRP
utilized	VBD

The	DT

RESULTS	NNS

In	IN

In	IN

In	FW

despite	IN

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
We	PRP
conclude	VBP
that	IN
,	,
compared	VBN

Ac-SDKP	NN
may	MD
