Pirfenidone	NNP
is	VBZ
an	DT
antifibrotic	JJ
drug	NN
,	,
recently	RB
approved	VBN
for	IN
the	DT
treatment	NN
of	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

Although	IN
pirfenidone	NN
exhibits	VBZ
anti-inflammatory	JJ
,	,
antioxidant	JJ

and	CC
antifibrotic	JJ
properties	NNS

the	DT
molecular	JJ
mechanism	NN
underlying	VBG

remains	VBZ

Here	RB

we	PRP
link	VBP
pirfenidone	NN
action	NN
with	IN
the	DT
regulation	NN
of	IN
the	DT
profibrotic	JJ
hedgehog	NN
(	(
Hh	NN

signaling	NN
pathway	NN
.	.

We	PRP
demonstrate	VBP
that	IN
pirfenidone	NN
selectively	RB
destabilizes	VBZ
the	DT
glioma-associated	JJ
oncogene	NN
homolog	NN
(	(

2	CD
protein	NN
,	,
the	DT
primary	JJ
activator	NN

Consequently	RB

pirfenidone	NN
decreases	VBZ

activity	NN
in	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
and	CC
in	IN
patient-derived	JJ

leads	VBZ

genes	NNS
,	,
such	JJ
as	IN
GLI1	NN

Hh	NN

Patched-1	NN

a-smooth-muscle-actin	NN

and	CC

and	CC

,	,
thus	RB
creating	VBG
a	DT
vicious	JJ

Because	IN
GLI	NNP
transcription	NN
factors	NNS
are	VBP
not	RB
only	RB
crucial	JJ
for	IN
Hh-mediated	JJ
changes	NNS
but	CC
are	VBP
also	RB
required	VBN
as	IN
mediators	NNS
of	IN
TGF-b	NN

our	PRP$

suggest	VBP
that	IN
