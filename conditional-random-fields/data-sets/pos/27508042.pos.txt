Idiopathic	JJ

Recent	JJ

critical	JJ

In	IN
this	DT

we	PRP

Balb/c	NN

Targtscan	NNP

The	DT

The	DT

partially	RB
rescue	VB

TGF-b-induced	JJ

Over-expression	NN
of	IN
SMO	NNP
led	VBD

the	DT
fibrotic	JJ
phenotype	NN

NuLi-1	NN
cells	NNS
even	RB
without	IN

These	DT
findings	NNS
showed	VBD
that	IN
the	DT
over-expression	NN

SMO	NNP
contributed	VBD

Furthermore	RB

in	FW

lentivirus-mediated	JJ
over-expression	NN

can	MD
alleviate	VB

In	IN
conclusion	NN

our	PRP$
results	NNS
suggest	VBP
that	IN
miR-338	NN

can	MD
target	VB

reduce	VB
