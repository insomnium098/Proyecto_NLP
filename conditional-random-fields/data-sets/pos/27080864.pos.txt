BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
CD248	NN
or	CC
Endosialin	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
transmembrane	JJ
molecule	NN
expressed	VBN
in	IN
stromal	JJ
cells	NNS
binding	VBG
to	TO
extracellular	JJ
matrix	NN
(	(
ECM	NN
)	)
components	NNS
.	.

It	PRP
has	VBZ
been	VBN
previously	RB
implicated	VBN
in	IN
kidney	NN
fibrosis	NN
,	,
rheumatoid	JJ
arthritis	NN
as	RB
well	RB
as	IN
in	IN
tumour-stromal	JJ
interactions	NNS

This	DT
study	NN
investigates	VBZ
the	DT
role	NN
of	IN
CD248	NN
in	IN
the	DT
pathogenesis	NN
of	IN
fibrotic	JJ
diseases	NNS
in	IN
Idiopathic	JJ
Pulmonary	JJ
Fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
.	.

METHODS	NNS
:	:
CD248	NN
quantitative	JJ
immunohistochemistry	NN
(	(
IHC	NN
)	)
was	VBD
performed	VBN
on	IN
lung	NN
samples	NNS
from	IN
22	CD
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
and	CC
its	PRP$
expression	NN
was	VBD
assayed	VBN
in	IN
cultured	VBN
pulmonary	JJ
fibroblasts	NNS
and	CC
epithelial	JJ
cells	NNS
.	.

Effects	NNS
of	IN
CD248	NN
silencing	NN
was	VBD
evaluated	VBN
on	IN
fibroblast	NN
proliferation	NN
and	CC
myofibroblast	NN
differentiation	NN
.	.

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
IHC	NNP
revealed	VBD
strong	JJ
CD248	NN
expression	NN
in	IN
mesenchymal	JJ
cells	NNS
of	IN
normal	JJ
lung	NN
structures	NNS
such	JJ
as	IN
pleura	NN
and	CC
adventitia	NN
but	CC
not	RB
in	IN
epithelium	NN
.	.

Fibrotic	JJ
areas	NNS
showed	VBD
markedly	RB
stronger	JJR
staining	NN
than	IN
unaffected	JJ
lung	NN

.	.

The	DT
extent	NN
of	IN
CD248	NN
staining	NN
showed	VBD
a	DT
significant	JJ
negative	JJ
correlation	NN
to	TO

FEV1	NN

FVC	NN

35	CD
,	,
p	NN
<	JJR
0	CD

)	)
.	.

CD248	NN
protein	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
significantly	RB
greater	JJR
in	IN
IPF-derived	JJ
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
vs	CC
normal	JJ
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
(	(
p	NN
<	JJR

and	CC
CD248	NN
silencing	NN
significantly	RB
reduced	VBD
the	DT

of	IN
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
,	,
but	CC
did	VBD
not	RB
affected	VBN
myofibroblast	NN

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
We	PRP
conclude	VBP
that	IN
CD248	NN
overexpression	NN
is	VBZ
possibly	RB
involved	VBN
in	IN
the	DT
pathogenesis	NN
of	IN
IPF	NN
and	CC
it	PRP
has	VBZ
potential	JJ
as	IN
a	DT
disease	NN
severity	NN
marker	NN
.	.

Given	VBN
that	IN
CD248	NN
ligands	NNS
are	VBP
collagen	NN
type	NN
I	CD
,	,
IV	CD
and	CC
fibronectin	NN
,	,
we	PRP
hypothesise	VBP
that	IN
CD248	NN
signalling	NN
represents	VBZ
a	DT
novel	JJ
matrix-fibroblast	NN
interaction	NN
that	WDT
may	MD
be	VB
a	DT
potential	JJ
therapeutic	JJ
target	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN
