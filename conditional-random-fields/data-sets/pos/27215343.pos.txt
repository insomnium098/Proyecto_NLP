BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
is	VBZ
a	DT
chronic	JJ
lung	NN
disorder	NN
of	IN
unknown	JJ
origin	NN
,	,
which	WDT
ultimately	RB
leads	VBZ
to	TO
death	NN
.	.

Several	JJ
growth	NN
factors	NNS
such	JJ
as	IN
IGFs	NNS
(	(
insulin-like-growth	JJ
factor	NN
)	)
and	CC
IGFBPs	NNS
(	(
insulin	NN
like	IN
growth	NN
factor	NN
binding	NN
proteins	NNS
)	)
seem	VBP
to	TO
take	VB
part	NN
to	TO
the	DT
pathogenesis	NN
.	.

We	PRP
evaluated	VBD
IGFs	NNS
and	CC
IGFBPs	NNS
in	IN
serum	NN
from	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
and	CC
healthy	JJ
subjects	NNS
including	VBG
24	CD
untreated	JJ
IPF	NN
and	CC
26	CD
IPF	NN
receiving	VBG
anti-fibrotic	JJ
therapy	NN
and	CC
to	TO
compare	VB
them	PRP
with	IN
healthy	JJ
subjects	NNS
.	.

METHODS	NNS
:	:
Serum	NN
of	IN
50	CD
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
and	CC
55	CD
healthy	JJ
subjects	NNS
(	(
HS	NN
)	)
were	VBD
analysed	VBN
by	IN
ELISA	NN
for	IN
IGFs	NNS
and	CC
IGFBPs	NNS
,	,
TGF-b	NN
and	CC
KL-6	NN
,	,
the	DT
latter	JJ
being	VBG
tested	VBN
as	IN
positive	JJ
control	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Serum	NN
levels	NNS
of	IN
IGFBP-1	NN
and	CC
IGFBP-2	NN
and	CC
KL-6	NN
were	VBD
significantly	RB
higher	JJR
in	IN
the	DT
IPF	NN
group	NN
than	IN
in	IN
the	DT
healthy	JJ
subjects	NNS
(	(

0.05	CD

p	NN
<	JJR
0.001	CD
and	CC
p	NN

0.0001	CD
respectively	RB
)	)
while	IN
the	DT
picture	NN
was	VBD
inversed	JJ
regarding	VBG
IGFs	NNS
.	.

By	IN
contrast	NN
there	EX
was	VBD
no	DT
significant	JJ
difference	NN
between	IN
the	DT
groups	NNS
with	IN
respect	NN
to	TO
TGF-b	NN
.	.

IGFBP-2	NN
was	VBD
significantly	RB
reduced	VBN
in	IN
the	DT
patients	NNS
with	IN
specific	JJ
anti-fibrotic	JJ
therapy	NN
pirfenidone	NN
and	CC
nintedanib	NN
compared	VBN
to	TO
untreated	JJ
patients	NNS
(	(
p	NN

but	CC
still	RB
significantly	RB
elevated	JJ
in	IN

to	TO
HS	NN

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
Serum	NN
IGFBP-1	NN
and	CC
-2	CD
are	VBP
increased	VBN
in	IN
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ

and	CC
IGFBP-2	NN
may	MD

IGFBPs	NNS
