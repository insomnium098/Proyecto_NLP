BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN

is	VBZ
a	DT
chronic	JJ
,	,
progressive	JJ
and	CC
fatal	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrotic	JJ
disease	NN
and	CC
useful	JJ
biomarkers	NNS

CCN2	NN
(	(
connective-tissue-growth-factor	NN

has	VBZ
been	VBN
reported	VBN
as	IN
one	CD
of	IN
the	DT
key	JJ
profibrotic	JJ
factors	NNS
associated	VBN
with	IN
transforming-growth-factor-b	NN
(	(

and	CC
its	PRP$

has	VBZ
potential	JJ
as	IN
a	DT
non-invasive	JJ

in	IN
various	JJ
fibrotic	JJ
diseases	NNS
.	.

Recently	RB
,	,
we	PRP
developed	VBD
a	DT
new	JJ
subtraction	NN
method	NN
for	IN
determination	NN
of	IN
plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
levels	NNS
.	.

We	PRP
examined	VBD
the	DT
utility	NN
of	IN
plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
levels	NNS
as	IN
a	DT
surrogate	JJ
marker	NN
in	IN

METHODS	NNS
:	:
Plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
calculated	VBN
in	IN
33	CD
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN

14	CD
patients	NNS

non-IPF	JJ
idiopathic	JJ

We	PRP
evaluated	VBD
the	DT

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
significantly	RB
higher	JJR
in	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
than	IN
in	IN
those	DT
with	IN
non-IPF	JJ
IIPs	NNS
and	CC
healthy	JJ
volunteers	NNS

Importantly	RB
,	,
plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
levels	NNS
showed	VBD
significantly	RB
negative	JJ

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

Plasma	NN
CCN2	NN
is	VBZ
