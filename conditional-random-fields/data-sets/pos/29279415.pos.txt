Recently	RB

leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein	NN

However	RB

the	DT

In	IN
this	DT

we	PRP

the	DT

by	IN
analyzing	VBG
LRG	NNP

an	DT

The	DT

In	IN

Moreover	RB

in	IN
the	DT

phosphorylation	NN

In	FW

indicated	VBD
that	IN

the	DT

the	DT

Although	IN
endoglin	NN

an	DT

is	VBZ
essential	JJ
for	IN
LRG	NNP

promote	VB
TGF-b	NN

in	IN
endothelial	JJ
cells	NNS
during	IN

we	PRP
found	VBD
that	IN

did	VBD
not	RB
contribute	VB

the	DT

Taken	VBN

our	PRP$

suggest	VBP
that	IN
