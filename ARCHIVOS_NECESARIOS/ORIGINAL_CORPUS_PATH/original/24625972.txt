BAX inhibitor-1-associated V-ATPase glycosylation enhances collagen degradation in pulmonary fibrosis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is considered one of the pathological mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, we examined whether an ER stress regulator, Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), regulates collagen accumulation, which is both a marker of fibrosis and a pathological mechanism of fibrosis. The presence of BI-1 inhibited the transforming growth factor-b1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial pulmonary cells and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model by enhancing collagen degradation, most likely by enhanced activation of the lysosomal V-ATPase through glycosylation. We also found a correlation between post-translational glycosylation of the V-ATPase and its associated chaperone, calnexin, in BI-1-overexpressing cells. BI-1-induced degradation of collagen through lysosomal V-ATPase glycosylation and the involvement of calnexin were confirmed in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model. These results highlight the regulatory role of BI-1 in IPF and reveal for the first time the role of lysosomal V-ATPase glycosylation in IPF.
