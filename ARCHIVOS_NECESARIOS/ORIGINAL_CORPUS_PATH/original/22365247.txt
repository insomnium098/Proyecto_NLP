Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: pathobiology of novel approaches to treatment. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of unknown cause that conveys a dismal prognosis. In the United States there are currently no licensed therapies for treatment of IPF. The development of effective IPF clinical trials networks across the United States and Europe, however, has led to key developments in the treatment of IPF. Advances in understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis have led to novel therapeutic targets. These developments offer hope that there may, in the near future, be therapeutic options available for treatment of this devastating disease.
