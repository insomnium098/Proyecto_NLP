Cthrc1 lowers pulmonary collagen associated with bleomycin-induced fibrosis and protects lung function. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) involves collagen deposition that results in a progressive decline in lung function. This process involves activation of Smad2/3 by transforming growth factor (TGF)-b and Wnt signaling pathways. Collagen Triple Helix Repeat-Containing-1 (Cthrc1) protein inhibits Smad2/3 activation. To test the hypothesis that Cthrc1 limits collagen deposition and the decline of lung function, Cthrc1 knockout (Cthrc1(-/-)) and wild-type mice (WT) received intratracheal injections of 2.5  U/kg bleomycin or saline. Lungs were harvested after 14  days and Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) TGF-b, IL1-b, hydroxyproline and lung compliance were assessed. TGF-b was significantly higher in Cthrc1(-/-) compared to WT (53.45      6.15  ng/mL vs. 34.48      11.05) after saline injection. Bleomycin injection increased TGF-b in both Cthrc1(-/-) (66.37      8.54  ng/mL) and WT (63.64      8.09  ng/mL). Hydroxyproline was significantly higher in Cthrc1(-/-) compared to WT after bleomycin-injection (2.676      0.527   g/mg vs. 1.889      0.520, P  =  0.028). Immunohistochemistry of Cthrc1(-/-) lung sections showed intracellular localization and activation of b-catenin Y654 in areas of tissue remodeling that was not evident in WT Lung compliance was significantly reduced by bleomycin in Cthrc1(-/-) but there was no effect in WT animals. These data suggest Cthrc1 reduces fibrotic tissue formation in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and the effect is potent enough to limit the decline in lung function. We conclude that Cthrc1 plays a protective role, limiting collagen deposition and could form the basis of a novel therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.
