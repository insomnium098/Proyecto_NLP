Determining the True Selectivity Profile of av Integrin Ligands Using Radioligand Binding: Applying an Old Solution to a New Problem. The arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid (RGD) integrin subfamily contains five members that partner with the av subunit: avb1, avb3, avb5, avb6, and avb8. Within the av integrins, the epithelially restricted avb6 has been identified as playing a key role in the activation of transforming growth factor b that is hypothesized to be pivotal in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). As part of a drug discovery program to identify a selective avb6 RGD mimetic for IPF, cell adhesion and radioligand binding assays were investigated to screen compounds to determine affinity and av integrin selectivity. In this study, a pan-av radioligand was characterized against all the av integrins and used to determine accurate selectivity profiles for literature and novel RGD ligands, as well as enable an early readout on avb6 dissociation kinetics. It has been shown that while cell adhesion offers a high throughput and reliable format for ranking compounds, there are downsides to this format when comparing selectivity across av integrins. By accurately defining the relationship between these assay formats, a medicinal chemistry effort has identified novel, high-affinity, and selective avb6 RGD mimetics with slow dissociation kinetics, with the potential to be developed into clinical candidates for IPF.
