Tannic acid attenuates TGF-b1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by effectively intervening TGF-b signaling in lung epithelial cells. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and an irreversible lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the extracellular matrix. The transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be one of the possible sources for a substantial increase in the number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in IPF lungs. Tannic acid (TA), a natural dietary polyphenolic compound has been shown to possess diverse pharmacological effects. However, whether TA can inhibit TGF-b1-mediated EMT in lung epithelial cells remains enigmatic. Both the human adenocarcinomic alveolar epithelial (A549) and normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells were treated with TGF-b1 with or without TA. Results showed that TA addition, markedly inhibited TGF-b1-induced EMT as assessed by reduced expression of N-cadherin, type-1-collagen, fibronectin, and vimentin. Furthermore, TA inhibited TGF-b1-induced cell proliferation through inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. TGF-b1-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Smad (Smad2 and 3), Akt as well as that of mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38) mediators was effectively inhibited by TA. On the other hand, TA reduced the TGF-b1-induced increase in TGF-b receptors expression. Using molecular docking approach, FTIR, HPLC and Western blot analyses, we further identified the direct binding of TA to TGF-b1. Finally, we conclude that TA might directly interact with TGF-b1, thereby repressing TGF-b signaling and subsequent EMT process in lung epithelial cells. Further animal studies are needed to clarify its potential therapeutic benefit in pulmonary fibrosis.
