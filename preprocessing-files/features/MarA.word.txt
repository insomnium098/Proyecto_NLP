PMID_8955629	1	These include the 13-kDa MarA protein ( Cohen et al. , 1993 ) , whose regulatory specificity overlaps that of SoxS ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ) , and the 33-kDa Rob protein , with an homologous N-terminus ( Skarstad et al. , 1993 ; Cohen et al. , 1993 ) .
PMID_8955629	2	Rob was identified by its binding to the right arm of the E. coli replication origin ( Skarstad et al. , 1993 ) ; we tested whether the sequence similarity of Rob , MarA and SoxS might underlie a regulatory overlap among these proteins .

PMID_8955629	4	The proteins ( SoxS , MarA , Rob , etc. ) are named after their respective genes .
PMID_8955629	5	The clear homology of SoxS and MarA suggests that these two proteins operate by a similar mechanism to activate some of the same genes , and our biochemical studies with the SoxS protein provide a clear guide for future work with MarA .
PMID_9097440	1	The MarA protein is a member of the AraC subfamily of helix-turn-helix transcriptional activators and has more than 45 % sequence identity with the SoxS and Rob proteins ( 10 , 14 , 15 ) .
PMID_9097440	2	The MarA protein controls a set of genes ( mar and soxRS regulons , including sodA , nfo , micF , inaA , fumC , zwf , and fpr ) and provides E. coli cells with resistance to a large number of antibiotics and superoxide-generating reagents ( 5 , 9 , 21 , 25 , 34 , 36 ) .
PMID_9097440	3	The partially determined DNA sequence and restriction enzyme map showed that the 3.0-kb fragment contained the 0.7-kb marRA locus , lacking the codons for the N-terminal 25 amino acids of MarR and the codons for the C-terminal 16 amino acids of MarA ( designated mar RA ) .
PMID_9097440	4	The MarA protein has strong homology with Rob and SoxS proteins .
PMID_9097440	5	Derepression of the mar operon causes an increase in MarA , a transcriptional activator protein , and elevates expression of the mar regulon genes ( 15 ) .
PMID_9097440	6	There is the possibility that activation of the stress response system by MarA , SoxS , and Rob activators nonspecifically increases the resistance to hydrophobic chemical compounds , including organic solvents .
PMID_9097440	7	Overexpression of the MarA positive regulator is sufficient to confer multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli .

PMID_9324261	1	The MarA protein is homologous to both SoxS , the effector of the soxRS regulon ( 14 , 32 ) , and RobA , a small protein that binds to the E. coli replication origin and some stress gene promoters ( 7 , 9 , 31 , 45 ) .
PMID_9324261	2	The better effect of the latter plasmid than those containing only marA could be linked to greater production of MarA protein from this plasmid ( as visualized by antibody to MarA [ 1 ] ) .
PMID_9324261	3	E. coli strains overexpressing MarA ( JHC1069 ; cfxB1/MarR mutation ) or SoxS ( JTG1078 ; soxR105 mutation ) grew in the presence of both n-hexane and cyclohexane , whereas wild-type GC4468 grew only in the presence of n-hexane ( Table 3 ) .
PMID_9324261	4	Western blot studies ( data not shown ) ( 1 ) with antibodies to MarA showed that this was at least partially due to increased expression of MarA , compared to TU2 alone , although the presence of marC may be additionally involved .
PMID_9324261	5	Overexpression of the MarA positive regulator is sufficient to confer multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli .
