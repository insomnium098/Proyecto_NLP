Expression of marA, soxS, orrobA in Escherichia coli

Escherichia coli K-12 strains are normally tolerant to n-hexane and susceptible to cyclohexane. Constitutive
expression of marA of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) locus or of the soxS or robA gene product
produced tolerance to cyclohexane. Inactivation of the mar locus or the robA locus, but not the soxRS locus,
increased organic solvent susceptibility in the wild type and Mar mutants (to both n-hexane and cyclohexane).
The organic solvent hypersusceptibility is a newly described phenotype for a robA-inactivated strain. Multicopy
expression of mar, soxS, orrobA induced cyclohexane tolerance in strains with a deleted or inactivated chromosomal
mar, soxRS, orrobA locus; thus, each transcriptional activator acts independently of the others.
However, in a strain with 39 kb of chromosomal DNA, including the mar locus, deleted, only the multicopy
complete mar locus, consisting of its two operons, produced cyclohexane tolerance. Deletion of acrAB from
either wild-type E. coli K-12 or a Mar mutant resulted in loss of tolerance to both n-hexane and cyclohexane.
Organic solvent tolerance mediated by mar, soxS, orrobA was not restored in strains with acrAB deleted. These
findings strongly suggest that active efflux specified by the acrAB locus is linked to intrinsic organic solvent
tolerance and to tolerance mediated by the marA, soxS, orrobA gene product in E. coli.
Organic solvents can be toxic to microorganisms, depending
on both the inherent toxicity of the solvent and the intrinsic
tolerance of the bacterial species and strain (3, 4, 28). Tolerance
to the solvent correlates with the logarithm of its partition
coefficient with n-octanol and water (log P ow) (12, 24–26).
Organic solvents with lower log P ows are more toxic to microorganisms
than are solvents with relatively higher log P ows. The
lowest log P ow in which a strain will grow is known as the index
value for that strain, and the solvent with that log P ow is known
as the index solvent (5).
The mechanism(s) of organic solvent toxicity is not well
understood. However, it has been believed that the solvents
cause cell-death because they accumulate and break down
microbial membranes (13, 27, 30, 48). Therefore, it is of interest
that mutants with increased organic solvent tolerance can
be isolated from Escherichia coli and other species (3, 4, 8, 19,
28, 39, 40).
The index solvent of E. coli K-12 is n-hexane (log P ow, 3.9).
Strains grow in the presence of n-hexane but not cyclohexane
(log P ow, 3.4) (3–5). Recently, mutants of E. coli K-12 strains
were derived that were tolerant to both n-hexane and cyclohexane
(5, 39, 40). These mutants were also found to be resistant
to structurally unrelated antibiotics in a pattern that resembled
the multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) phenotype (5,
39, 40). We reported earlier that overexpression of marA increased
the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli strains (19).
More recently, other workers have demonstrated that overexpression
of marA can cause cyclohexane tolerance (8).

chromosomal map, is involved in the regulation of intrinsic
susceptibility to structurally unrelated antibiotics (9–11, 18),
the expression of antioxidant genes (6, 20), and internal pH
homeostasis (43). The mar locus consists of two transcription
units, marC (TU1) and marRAB (TU2), which are divergently
transcribed from a central putative operator-promoter region
(marO) (9, 18). marR is the repressor of the marORAB operon
(9, 36, 44). Overexpression of marA alone produces the multiple
antibiotic resistance phenotype (9, 16, 50). marB has no
effect of its own; however, when it is present on the same
construct with marA, it produces a small increase in antibiotic
resistance (47). The function of marC is unknown; however, it
also appears to enhance the multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype
when cloned on the same DNA fragment with the
marRAB operon (18, 47).
The MarA protein is homologous to both SoxS, the effector
of the soxRS regulon (14, 32), and RobA, a small protein that
binds to the E. coli replication origin and some stress gene
promoters (7, 9, 31, 45). The soxRS regulon mediates the cell’s
response-to-oxidative-stress (2, 41, 49). Overexpression of either
soxS or robA in E. coli produces both increased organic
solvent tolerance and low-level resistance to multiple antimicrobial
agents (7, 39, 40).
Overexpression of marA causes increased efflux of antibiotics,
including fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol
(10, 17, 37). Transcription of the acrAB operon, a
multicomponent, multidrug efflux pump whose expression is
modulated by global stress signals (33, 34), was shown to be
elevated in strains containing marR mutations and displaying
the Mar phenotype (42). Moreover, inactivation of acrAB led
to increased antibiotic susceptibility in the wild type and in Mar
mutants (42).
We investigated the role of the acr and mar loci in organic
solvent tolerance and the effect of the mar locus on organic
solvent tolerance mediated by expression of either robA or
soxS.

Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology [19].)
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids. The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this
study and their relevant properties are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise noted,
bacteria were grown and maintained at 30°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB
agar (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) plates with or without the appropriate antibiotics for
selection. E. coli AG100-A, AG100-B, and AG102-A were kindly provided by H.
Nikaido (42).
Chemicals. Organic solvents were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee,
Wis.). Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
Mo.). Isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was obtained from Alexis
Corporation (San Diego, Calif.).
DNA manipulations. Plasmid DNA was prepared by using the Wizard Prep Kit
(Promega, Madison, Wis.). Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were
purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, Mass.) and used under conditions
suggested by the supplier. PCR amplification was carried out with a Perkin
Elmer-Cetus DNA thermal cycler 480. Taq polymerase and reagents were provided
by Perkin Elmer-Cetus and used as directed by the supplier. Primers were
created which flanked the coding sequence and allowed amplification of marAB
(1,893 to 2,592 bp of the published sequence; reference 9). This PCR amplicon
was approximately 699 bp long. Restriction endonuclease sites for EcoRI and
PstI were incorporated into the ends of the PCR primers to ensure that insertion
of fragments was in the correct orientation when they were cloned into pSE380,
a high-copy-number expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The resulting
plasmid construct was called pSMarAB.
DNA fragments from low-melting-point agarose gels, as well as PCR products,
were purified by using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth,
Calif.). DNA transformation was performed by using the CaCl 2 procedure as
previously described (9), and pSE380 clones were selected by using LB agar
plates containing ampicillin (100 �g/ml), IPTG (0.1 mM), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-
3-�-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal; 40 �g/ml).
Organic solvent tolerance assays. Organic solvent tolerance of bacterial
strains grown to late logarithmic phase was measured in cultures diluted to a
concentration of approximately 10 7 cells/ml. A 5-�l aliquot of the bacterial
suspension was plated on LB agar and allowed to dry. An organic solvent was
overlaid to a depth of 2 to 3 mm. The plate was sealed and incubated overnight
at 30°C (5). Cyclohexane, n-hexane, and n-pentane were used as the organic
solvents. IPTG was added to the agar plates at a concentration of 0.5 mM when

induction of plasmid genes was required. For efficiency-of-plating (EOP) experiments,
logarithmic-phase cultures were diluted to an optical density at 530 nm
of 0.2 and 100-�l aliquots of cells from serial dilutions were spread onto LB agar
plates. As mentioned above, an organic solvent was then overlaid to a depth of
2 to 3 mm and the plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 30°C. Platings
were done in duplicate, and colonies were counted. Growth was recorded as
confluent growth (��), visible growth (�100 colonies; �), or no growth (�).
RESULTS
The organic solvent tolerance of E. coli K-12 strain AG100
was compared to that of an isogenic strain that constitutively
expresses the mar operon due to a mutation in marR (AG102)
(9). AG100 grew in the presence of n-hexane only; AG102
grew in the presence of n-hexane, cyclohexane (Table 2), and
n-pentane (data not shown). Thus, constitutive expression of
the mar locus changed the index solvent from n-hexane (log
P ow, 3.9) to n-pentane (log P ow, 3.3).
In the wild-type E. coli AG100 background, overexpression
of marA (on plasmid pSMarAB or pMAK-TU2), soxS (on
pSXS), or robA (on pSRob) resulted in cyclohexane tolerance
(Table 2). marC by itself (pMAK-TU1) had no effect on cyclohexane
tolerance; however, introduction of marCORAB on
low-copy plasmid pMAK705 (pMAK-TU1&TU2) resulted in
cyclohexane tolerance (Table 2).
When the mar locus was inactivated by replacement with a
kanamycin resistance cassette (AG100K) (35), the strain became
hypersusceptible to n-hexane compared to the wild-type
strain (Table 2). MCH164 (a derivative of AG100 from which
39 kb of chromosomal DNA, including the entire mar locus,
had been deleted [18, 37]) was, as expected, also hypersusceptible
to organic solvents (Table 2). Expression in trans of marA,
soxS, orrobA in AG100K restored n-hexane tolerance and
increased cyclohexane tolerance in the cell (Table 2). Expression
in trans in AG100K of marA, specified from plasmid

pMAK-TU1&TU2, restored n-hexane tolerance and produced
higher cyclohexane tolerance (Table 2). The better effect of the
latter plasmid than those containing only marA could be linked
to greater production of MarA protein from this plasmid (as
visualized by antibody to MarA [1]). While introduction of
either marA, soxS, or robA restored n-hexane tolerance in
MCH164, only pMAK-TU1&TU2 produced cyclohexane tolerance
in this larger deletion mutant (Table 2).
Since acrAB deletion dramatically decreased multiple drug
resistance in Mar mutants (42), we examined its possible role
in organic solvent tolerance. Overexpression of acrAB, because
of a mutation in acrR in AG100-B, enabled the strain to grow
in the presence of cyclohexane (Table 2). Deletion of acrAB
from wild-type AG100 (AG100-A) resulted in n-hexane sensitivity
(Table 2). Deletion of acrAB from the Mar mutant
AG102 (AG102-A) resulted in sensitivity to both n-hexane and
cyclohexane. Expression of marA, soxS, orrobA in AG102-A
failed to restore organic solvent tolerance, further demonstrating
the critical role of acrAB (Table 2).
We next investigated a series of isogenic strains in which sox,
mar, and robA were either overexpressed, deleted, or inactivated
(Table 3). E. coli strains overexpressing MarA (JHC1069;
cfxB1/MarR mutation) or SoxS (JTG1078; soxR105 mutation)
grew in the presence of both n-hexane and cyclohexane, whereas
wild-type GC4468 grew only in the presence of n-hexane
(Table 3). Much like the situation in AG100, introduction of
either pSMarAB, pMAK-TU2, pMAK-TU1&TU2, pSXS, or
pSRob into GC4468 produced cyclohexane tolerance. Inactivation
of robA by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette
(RA4468) caused n-hexane susceptibility (Table 3). Introduction
of either marA (on pMAK-TU1&TU2, pMAK-TU2, or
pSMarAB), soxS (on pSXS), or robA (on pSRob) into the robAinactivated
strain increased tolerance to both n-hexane and
cyclohexane (Table 3). Deletion of soxRS (DJ901) had little
effect on n-hexane tolerance (Table 3). Introduction of marA,
soxS, orrobA into the �soxRS strain produced cyclohexane
tolerance (Table 3). In all of these complementations, the best
effect of marA was obtained with plasmid pMAK-TU1&TU2.
Since Mar mutant strain AG102 grew confluently in the
presence of cyclohexane and the acrR mutant form of strain
AG100 (AG100-B) grew less well, we tried a different method,
namely, an EOP assay to compare growth in the presence of
cyclohexane (Table 4). AG102 had a greater EOP (73%) in
cyclohexane than did AG100-B (EOP, 13%). The sixfold difference
confirmed, although perhaps less dramatically, the spot
test results.
DISCUSSION
The mar locus affects intrinsic multidrug susceptibility or
resistance in E. coli and when activated provides the cell with

a response to a variety of environmental stimuli and stresses (6,
11, 18, 20, 38, 43). One such stress could certainly include
growth in an environment containing organic solvents. This
possibility was suggested in work by Aono et al. (5), who reported
that cyclohexane-tolerant mutants of E. coli also displayed
the Mar phenotype (low-level multidrug-resistance).
Various genes are thought to be involved in organic solvent
tolerance in E. coli, but the mechanisms of tolerance have not
been identified. Of those investigated, a gene designated ostA,
when transduced from an n-hexane-tolerant E. coli strain into
a hexane-sensitive strain, restored hexane tolerance (4). Unexpectedly,
a gene encoding alkylhydroperoxide reductase also
produced organic solvent resistance (15). A soxR mutation,
overexpression of the cloned soxS gene, or overexpression of
robA increased the levels of organic solvent tolerance in E. coli
(39, 40).
We showed earlier that an E. coli Mar mutant (AG102)
selected for multiple antibiotic resistance was more tolerant to
organic solvents than was its wild-type parent strain AG100
(19). Conversely, a mutant of AG100 selected for growth in the
presence of cyclohexane was found to be multidrug resistant
with overexpression of marA (22). Introduction of marA on
low- or high-copy-number plasmids into AG100 generated cyclohexane
tolerance (19) (Table 2). Therefore, the marA-mediated
increased organic solvent tolerance can be produced in
a wild-type background without mutations elsewhere on the
chromosome.
Inactivation or deletion of the mar locus has been shown to
restore wild-type antibiotic susceptibilities to Mar mutants (9,
17) and abolish the protection provided against the rapid bactericidal
effects of fluoroquinolones (18). When the wild-type
mar locus was inactivated by replacement with a kanamycin
resistance cassette (AG100K) or by a 39-kb deletion (MCH164),
the strains became hypersusceptible to n-hexane compared
with the wild-type strain (Table 2).
In a hypersusceptible strain background with mar deleted
(AG100K), overexpression of soxS, robA, ormarA restored
tolerance to n-hexane and produced growth on cyclohexane.
However, in a strain missing the mar locus and �35 kb of
adjacent DNA (MCH164), overexpression of soxS, robA, or
marA could not induce cyclohexane tolerance (Table 2). Only
the plasmid containing marRAB and marC, carried on the large
fragment cloned in pMAK-TU1&TU2, produced growth on
cyclohexane. These findings suggested that other genes deleted
in MCH164 are required for robA-, soxS-, or marA-mediated
cyclohexane tolerance. Alternatively, much higher expression
of these activators may be needed in this strain background,
although it is interesting that soxS and robA on the same
plasmids were able to generate strong cyclohexane tolerance in
the other strains tested (Tables 2 and 3).
Expression of TU1 (marC) by itself had no effect on organic
solvent tolerance. As discussed above, when present with
marAB (TU2) on the same chromosomal fragment, it enhanced
the complementation in trans by marA. Western blot
studies (data not shown) (1) with antibodies to MarA showed
that this was at least partially due to increased expression of
MarA, compared to TU2 alone, although the presence of
marC may be additionally involved. It is interesting that the
TU1&TU2 fragment was also required for resistance to rapid
cell-killing by fluoroquinolones in this strain (18).
Inactivation of robA by insertion of a kanamycin resistance
cassette (RA4468) resulted in increased n-hexane susceptibility,
evidently the first phenotype described for robA-inactivated
cells. However, deletion of soxRS (DJ901) caused no detectable
effect on n-hexane tolerance (Table 3). Thus, the mar and
rob loci are more involved with basal organic solvent tolerance
than is soxRS. Introduction of any of the three transcriptional
activators into a robA- orsoxRS-inactivated strain increased
n-hexane tolerance and increased cyclohexane tolerance.
These findings contrast with a previous report that organic
solvent tolerance mediated by overexpression of robA was dependent
on soxRS (39). This unexplained disparity may be due
to strain differences. Therefore, each of the three loci can
mediate organic solvent tolerance independently of the others.
Recent work has identified the AcrAB efflux system as the
major mechanism responsible for the multidrug-resistance in
Mar mutants (42). Deletion of acrAB from either wild-type
AG100 (AG100-A) or the Mar mutant form of AG102
(AG102-A) resulted in loss of tolerance to the index organic
solvent n-hexane. Increased organic solvent tolerance was not
restored in AG102-A by any of the transcriptional activators
(Table 2). Mutation of acrR (in AG100-B, in which acrAB is
overexpressed) permitted the strain to grow on cyclohexane
(Table 2). These results indicate that AcrAB plays a major role
in the organic solvent tolerance phenotype of E. coli. Ina
comparison between isogenic strains overexpressing marA or
acrAB, the Mar mutant showed greater cyclohexane tolerance
(Tables 2 and 4). This finding may reflect greater expression of
acrAB in Mar mutants or a combination of acrAB overexpression
and the other changes occurring in a Mar mutant. It is
interesting that efflux was associated with toluene resistance in
Pseudomonas putida, although the genes were not identified
(29).
In summary, all three transcriptional activators (marA, soxS,
and robA) can independently produce organic solvent tolerance
in E. coli; all require the acrAB locus. For complementation
of the large deletion mutant MCH164, however, only the
plasmid bearing both transcriptional units of the mutant mar
locus produced cyclohexane tolerance (Table 2). These results
strongly suggest that these transcriptional activators produce
organic solvent tolerance by up regulating the acrAB locus,
resulting in increased efflux of the solvents from the cell.
