by Overexpression of marA in Escherichia coli

We previously reported that overexpression of the soxS or robA gene causes in several Escherichia coli strains
the acquisition of higher organic solvent tolerance and also increased resistance to a number of antibiotics (H.
Nakajima, K. Kobayashi, M. Kobayashi, H. Asako, and R. Aono, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:2302–2307,
1995). Most E. coli strains cannot grow in the presence of cyclohexane. We isolated the marRAB genes from a
Kohara � phage clone and cyclohexane-tolerant mutant strain OST3408. We found a substitution of serine for
arginine at position 73 in the coding region of marR of OST3408 and designated the gene marR08. Our genetic
analysis revealed that marR08 is responsible for the cyclohexane-tolerant phenotype. We observed that the
marA gene on high-copy-number plasmids increased the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli strains. Furthermore,
exposure of E. coli cells to salicylate, which activates the mar regulon genes, also raised organic solvent
tolerance. Overexpression of the marA, soxS, orrobA gene increased resistance to numerous antibiotics but not
to hydrophilic aminoglycosides.
Most water-immiscible organic solvents are generally toxic
to microorganisms. In a nonionizable organic solvent-aqueous
two-phase culture, toxicity of an organic solvent is inversely
correlated with the log of the partition in n-octanol–water
(logP ow value) (12) of the solvent (18, 19). An organic solvent
with a low logP ow value is generally toxic to most microorganisms.
Organic solvent tolerance levels of microorganisms significantly
differ with species. For example, while Escherichia
coli IFO3806 grows in the presence of organic solvents which
have greater logP ow values than propylbenzene (logP ow, 3.8),
Pseudomonas putida IFO3738 grows even in the presence of
p-xylene (logP ow, 3.1) (18). In recent years, highly organic
solvent-tolerant microorganisms, which thrive in the presence
of toluene (logP ow, 2.7), were isolated from forest or garden
soil and identified as P. putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Pseudomonas fluorescens (2, 18, 31). E. coli JA300 grows in the
presence of n-hexane (logP ow, 3.9) but not in the presence of
cyclohexane (logP ow, 3.4) (1). We isolated a series of organic
solvent-tolerant mutants from strain JA300. One of the mutants,
OST3408, shows growth in the presence of cyclohexane,
and the most tolerant mutant, OST3121, can grow in the presence
of p-xylene (1). We previously reported that the organic
solvent tolerance levels of E. coli strains can be improved by
overexpression of the stress response genes soxS and robA (32,
33). The soxS or robA gene on high-copy-number plasmids
under control of the lac promoter confers cyclohexane tolerance
to JA300. Overexpression of the robA gene also raises
resistance to a number of antibiotics and heavy metal ions. The
spectrum of resistance to antibiotics is similar to that of the
soxS-overexpressing strain (33). A number of spontaneously
isolated cyclohexane-tolerant mutants of JA300 simultaneously
acquired resistance to low levels of ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
nalidixic acid, and tetracycline but became more
sensitive to kanamycin than JA300 (4).

can be induced in E. coli by derepression of the marRAB
operon. The marRAB region at 34 min on the E. coli chromosome
has been cloned and sequenced (10), and its regulation
has been studied. The marRAB operon is negatively autoregulated
by the MarR protein, which binds to the marRAB promoter
region in vitro (27). Treatment with certain antibiotics
or aromatic weak acids such as salicylate or acetylsalicylate
derepresses this operon (11, 16, 28). The MarA protein is a
member of the AraC subfamily of helix-turn-helix transcriptional
activators and has more than 45% sequence identity with
the SoxS and Rob proteins (10, 14, 15). The MarA protein
controls a set of genes (mar and soxRS regulons, including
sodA, nfo, micF, inaA, fumC, zwf, and fpr) and provides E. coli
cells with resistance to a large number of antibiotics and superoxide-generating
reagents (5, 9, 21, 25, 34, 36).
We report here the acquisition of higher organic solvent
tolerance in several E. coli strains by the high-copy-number
marA gene or by exposure to salicylate. We identify marR08
mutation, which is responsible for the cyclohexane-tolerant
phenotype of OST3408 and its derivatives. Overexpression of
the marA, soxS, orrobA gene also increases the resistance to
numerous hydrophobic antibiotics but not to highly hydrophilic
aminoglycosides.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids. The E. coli strains used in this study are listed
in Table 1. Charomid 9-28 (a cosmid vector for cloning a 10- to 24-kb DNA
fragment) was purchased from Nippon Gene Co. (Tokyo, Japan) (35). pBluescript
II (pBSII) KS � and SK � vectors were purchased from Toyobo Biochemical,
Inc. (Osaka, Japan). pHc3R is pBSII carrying the soxS gene on a 0.4-kb
HincII fragment under the control of the lac promoter (32). pOST41BR is pBSII
carrying the robA gene on a 1.9-kb SalI-BamHI fragment under the control of the
lac promoter (33). �305 (2H2) is a Kohara � phage clone which spans the min 34
region on the E. coli chromosome (23). Plasmid pHA102 is pBSII SK � carrying
the marRAB genes on a 2.0-kb ScaI-ClaI fragment derived from �305. pHA103,
pHA104, pHA105, pHA106, and pHA107 are deletion derivatives from pHA102
containing the marAB, marR, marA, marB, and marRA genes, respectively (see
Fig. 1a).
Media and chemicals. E. coli cells were grown in modified Luria broth (LBG
medium; pH was adjusted to 7.0) consisting of 1% (wt/vol) Bacto Tryptone
(Difco Laboratories), 0.5% Bacto Yeast Extract (Difco), 1% NaCl, and 0.1%
glucose at 37�C. In organic solvent tolerance assays, MgSO 4 was added (10 mM)
to the LBG medium (LBGMg medium) to stabilize the viability of E. coli cells in

the presence of solvents (19). Organic solvents used for this study, diphenyl
ether, n-hexane, cyclohexane, and p-xylene, were purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Chloramphenicol, enoxacin, erythromycin,
gentamicin, kanamycin, kasugamycin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, norfloxacin, novobiocin,
ofloxacin, and phosphomycin (Sigma Chemical Co., Rahway, N.J.) and
tetracycline hydrochloride (Wako Pure Chemical) were used for the antibiotic
resistance assay. The logP ow values of antibiotics were calculated by the ClogP
program (Adam Net Co., Tokyo, Japan) (24).
Organic solvent tolerance assay. (i) Liquid-medium assay. A 100-�l culture of
overnight-grown E. coli W3110 cells carrying pHA104 (marR) or pHA105
(marA) was inoculated to 10 ml of fresh LBGMg medium and incubated at 37�C.
At the early exponential phase of growth, the culture was overlaid with a 10%
volume of cyclohexane and incubated at 37�C with shaking. Growth was monitored
by measuring turbidity (optical density at 660 nm) and by counting the
number of viable cells in the aqueous layer.
(ii) Solid-medium assay. Freshly grown E. coli cells were suspended in 0.9%
NaCl (approximately 10 7 cells per ml), and a drop of the suspension (5 �l) was
spotted on a solid LBGMg medium. The surface of the medium was overlaid
with an organic solvent to a thickness of 3 mm. The plates were sealed and
incubated at 37�C for 14 h.
In order to examine the effect of salicylate on organic solvent tolerance,
colony-forming efficiency was measured. W3110 cells carrying pBSII or pHA105
were grown in LBGMg medium (pH 7.0). At early stationary phase, the culture
was diluted 20-fold with fresh LBGMg medium (5 ml) containing 2 mM sodium
salicylate and incubated at 30�C for 100 min. When the cell turbidity (optical
density at 660 nm) reached 0.4, serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures were
prepared and 5 �l of each suspension was spotted onto solid LBGMg medium
containing 2 mM sodium salicylate. Approximately 10 5 ,10 4 ,10 3 ,10 2 , and 10 cells
were contained in the spots. The medium was overlaid with cyclohexane and
incubated at 37�C for 16 h.
Antibiotic susceptibility. The MICs of various antibiotics were determined by
a sequential dilution method (33). LBG medium liquid cultures containing different
concentrations of antibiotic and freshly grown 10 3 cells of the tested E. coli
strain were incubated at 37�C for 18 h. The lowest concentration of antibiotic
which completely inhibited growth was defined as the MIC (15).
Genetic analysis. DNA manipulations, including preparation of E. coli chromosomal
DNA, plasmid DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digestion and
ligation, and transformation of E. coli, were carried out by standard methods
(26). Chromosome DNA fragments of E. coli OST3408 were ligated with Charomid
9-28 and infected into JA300 cells by use of an in vitro packaging kit
(LAMBDA INN; Nippon Gene Co.). Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were
purchased from Biologica Co. (Nagoya, Japan). The marRAB region of OST3408
was amplified from the chromosome DNA by the TaKaRa EX Taq PCR method
(TakaraShuzo Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) using GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Nucleotide sequences of the
cloned DNA fragments were determined with a DNA sequencing system (model
373A; Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequence data were analyzed
with the BioDatabase CD-ROM GENETYX-MAC/CD (Software Development
Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Generalized transduction was done with phage P1kc by the method described
by Miller (30).
RESULTS
Cloning of the mar operon genes. Chromosomal DNA of E.
coli OST3408 (cyclohexane tolerant [CH r ]) was prepared and
partially digested with KpnI. The DNA fragments were inserted
into cosmid vector Charomid 9-28 and were introduced
into JA300 (cyclohexane-sensitive [CH s ]) cells. From 3.3 � 10 4
ampicillin-resistant transformants, nine CH r colonies were selected.
Plasmid pE1, containing a 20-kb DNA insert, was recovered
from one of the colonies. Subclone analysis of the
insert DNA on high-copy-number vector pBSII revealed that
one of the plasmids containing a 3.0-kb fragment (designated
pOST482) provided cyclohexane tolerance to JA300.
The partially determined DNA sequence and restriction enzyme
map showed that the 3.0-kb fragment contained the
0.7-kb marRA locus, lacking the codons for the N-terminal 25
amino acids of MarR and the codons for the C-terminal 16
amino acids of MarA (designated mar�RA�). We obtained a
complete length of the marRAB gene from the Kohara phage
library 2H2 clone (23). A 2.0-kb ScaI-ClaI DNA fragment
containing the marRAB region was subcloned into pBSII. The
resultant plasmid, pHA102, was utilized for the following subcloning
experiments (Fig. 1a).
The marR08 mutation is responsible for the cyclohexanetolerant
phenotype of OST3408. We designed a sense primer
(5�-TCGCTATGGTTCCCGGACCGGC-3�) and an antisense
primer (5�-GCAACCATGATTCACAGTCTGGTTA-3�) based
on the 5� and 3� flanking sequences of the marRAB operon,
respectively. In order to isolate the full-length marRAB operon
from OST3408, PCR was performed using these synthesized
oligonucleotides as primers and chromosome DNA of
OST3408 as a template. From the resultant PCR product, the
1.9-kb ScaI-ClaI DNA fragment containing the marRAB region
was cloned into pBSII. DNA sequence analysis showed
that the marR gene derived from OST3408 has one novel point
mutation, a C3Atransition at codon 73 (Arg3Ser) (Fig.
1b). We defined this mutant marR gene as marR08. We investigated
whether the marR08 mutation is involved in the cyclohexane-tolerant
phenotype. Transposon zde-234::Tn10 (Tc r )of
E. coli PLK1110 is 0.4 min distant from the mar locus on the E.
coli chromosome map. P1kc phage grown on PLK1110 (Tc r
CH s ) was used to infect the recipient, OST3408 (Tc s CH r ).
From 21 Tc r transductants, 11 strains showed cyclohexane tolerance
(CH r ) and the others lost the tolerance (CH s ). One of
the Tc r CH r strains, designated OST3408Tc, was used for further
analysis. P1kc phage grown on OST3408Tc was used to
infect Tc s -, CH s -recipient strains JA300, OST4251, MC1061,
and FS1576. From the selected Tc r transductants, 12% (6 of
50; JA300), 11% (2 of 18; OST4251), 9% (5 of 55; FS1576),
and 18% (18 of 100; MC1061) of the strains showed the CH r
phenotype. OST3408 and OST3408Tc were resistant to two- to
fourfold higher concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
and nalidixic acid compared with JA300 and CH s transduction
derivatives. We isolated the mar locus DNA fragment from
one of the Tc r CH r transductants derived from JA300. Sequence
analysis revealed that the CH r strain contained the
marR08 mutation. These results indicate that the marR08 mutation
is responsible for the cyclohexane-tolerant phenotype of
OST3408 and its derivatives.
Effect of marR or marA gene-expression on organic solvent
tolerance. We constructed a series of subclones containing the
marAB, marR, marA, marB, and marRA genes on high-copynumber
vectors, designated pHA103, pHA104, pHA105,
pHA106, and pHA107, respectively. Figure 1a shows the cyclohexane
tolerance acquisition of JA300 cells carrying the
marA gene under control of the lac promoter (pHA102,
pHA103, pHA105, and pHA107). JA300 cells carrying the
marA gene on a low-copy-number vector, pMW118, showed no
growth in the presence of cyclohexane (pHA105L). These results
indicate that overexpression of the marA gene increases
organic solvent tolerance in E. coli. The high-copy-number
marB gene (pHA106) had no effects on solvent tolerance.
Interestingly, the marR08 gene on high-copy-number vectors

(pOST482 and pR08) raised the organic solvent tolerance of
JA300.
Turbidity and viability of W3110 cells carrying the highcopy-number
marR or marA gene in the presence of organic
solvent were measured. When cyclohexane was added to
W3110 culture (10% [vol/vol]) at the early exponential phase
of growth (approximately 5 � 10 7 cells/ml), the increase in
turbidity completely stopped and the number of viable cells
decreased by 10 �3 (Fig. 2). W3110 cells carrying pHA105
(marA) maintained slow growth even in the presence of cyclohexane.
The number of viable cells carrying pHA105 stayed
between 5 � 10 6 and 2 � 10 7 /ml in 8 h. In contrast, the number
of viable cells carrying pHA104 (marR) rapidly decreased to
10 2 /ml by addition of cyclohexane (Fig. 2b). These growth
characteristics indicate opposite functions of the marA and
marR genes in susceptibility to organic solvents.
Overexpression of marA increases organic solvent tolerance
in several E. coli strains. We investigated the effects of overexpression
of the marA and marR genes on organic solvent
tolerance of several E. coli strains. Table 2 shows that most of
the tested strains carrying the high-copy-number marA plasmid
grew in the presence of cyclohexane. n-Hexane-sensitive strain
DH1 acquired n-hexane tolerance by pHA105. These results
suggest that the high-copy-number marA gene generally raises
organic solvent tolerance levels of E. coli strains. No additional
increase in the organic solvent tolerance of strain OST3408
was observed. On the other hand, overexpression of the marR
gene decreased organic solvent tolerance levels of E. coli
strains.
Effect of salicylate on organic solvent tolerance. Exposure of
E. coli cells to salicylate derepresses the mar operon and increases
resistance to several antibiotics (11). We investigated
organic solvent tolerance levels of E. coli cells exposed to
salicylate. Freshly grown W3110 cells were provided for assay
of colony-forming efficiency on LBGMg medium containing 2
mM sodium salicylate in the presence of cyclohexane. Although
W3110 treated with salicylate formed two colonies
from 10 cells, noninduced cells formed no colonies from 10 4
cells (Fig. 3). W3110 cells carrying the high-copy-number
marA plasmid showed the same colony-forming efficiency
(Fig. 3).

Overexpression of the marA, robA, orsoxS gene increases
resistance to hydrophobic antibiotics. The MarA protein has
strong homology with Rob and SoxS proteins. We previously
reported the close correlation between organic solvent tolerance
and antibiotic resistance (4), with kanamycin as an exception.
We calculated logP ow values of antibiotics from their
structures and found that kanamycin (logP ow, �7.77) is highly
hydrophilic. MICs of antibiotics, including highly hydrophilic
substances, were measured in W3110 cells carrying the highcopy-number
marA, robA, orsoxS plasmid. These stress response
gene-activating cells showed increases in resistance to
hydrophobic antibiotics, including novobiocin (logP ow, 3.84),
nalidixic acid (logP ow, 1.57), chloramphenicol (logP ow, 1.14),

DISCUSSION
We isolated the mar operon region from an organic solventtolerant
mutant E. coli strain, OST3408, and found a substitution
mutation in the marR08 gene coding region. The MarR
protein binds to the mar operator sequences and negatively
regulates expression of the marRAB operon (27). The marA
gene on a high-copy-number plasmid increased the organic
solvent tolerance of several E. coli strains. On the other hand,
the high-copy-number wild-type marR plasmid but not the
marR08 plasmid decreased solvent tolerance. P1 transduction
analysis revealed that the mar locus of the OST3408 strain is
involved in the cyclohexane-tolerant phenotype.
Mutations in the marR locus generally derepress the mar
operon. Several marR mutations (e.g., marR1, soxQ1, and
cfxB1), which have pleiotropic effects on antibiotic resistance
and expression of oxidative stress genes, have been reported
elsewhere (5). The MarR protein shows homology to a group
of similarly small proteins containing EmrR, PecS, and HpcR,
which act as negative regulators (37). The mutations in soxQ1
(A70T), marR1 (R77L) and marR08 (R73S) are located at the

conserved region of the marR gene. We believe that the
marR08 gene loses its function as a mar repressor and derepresses
the mar operon. We observed that overexpression of
the marR08 gene conferred cyclohexane tolerance on JA300,
which has the wild-type marR gene on its chromosome. On the
other hand, strain OST3408 carrying the high-copy-number
wild-type marR gene (pHA104; Table 2) lost cyclohexane tolerance.
MarR is considered to form concentration-dependent
oligomeric structures to bind the marO operator (37). This
result suggests that MarR08 forms heterologous, less functional
multimers with wild-type MarR, but excess wild-type
MarR can form a functional structure in spite of the existence
of MarR08. Several E. coli strains were provided the cyclohexane-tolerant
phenotype by introducing the mar locus of
OST3408 utilizing P1kc transduction selected with the
zde-234::Tn10 marker. Introduction of this locus by P1 transduction
may be a useful method for improving organic solvent
tolerance of E. coli strains.
We observed that exposure to salicylate increases the organic
solvent tolerance of E. coli cells. This result is expected
and reasonable. Salicylate appears to induce the mar operon by
binding to MarR and inhibiting complex formation with the
marO operator (27). But it is not easy to optimize the condition
of salicylate exposure, because salicylate itself is toxic to microorganisms.
Cohen et al. reported that exposure of E. coli
cells to 5 mM sodium salicylate increased resistance to various
antibiotics (11). We observed that exposure to 5 mM sodium
salicylate slightly inhibited growth of W3110 cells and decreased
organic solvent tolerance. Exposure to 0.5 mM salicylate
had no effect on the solvent tolerance of E. coli W3110
(data not shown). We also observed that treatment with redoxcycling
reagent, which induces the sox regulon genes, increases
organic solvent tolerance at the same level of overexpression of
the soxS gene in several E. coli strains (data not shown). Addition
of these chemical compounds is a simple and convenient
method to improve the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli
strains. We expect that this method may be utilized for industrial
E. coli strains.
Derepression of the mar operon causes an increase in MarA,
a transcriptional activator protein, and elevates expression of
the mar regulon genes (15). We observed that overexpression
of the marA gene raised the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli
strains. We conclude that induction of mar regulon genes increases
organic solvent tolerance of E. coli cells.
We previously reported that overexpression of the soxS and
robA genes increased organic solvent tolerance in E. coli (32,
33). Some of the mar regulon genes overlap members of the
soxRS regulon (21). Overexpression of the Rob protein increases
resistance to multiple antibiotics, including chloramphenicol,
tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and puromycin (6, 33).
We propose that overexpression of the marA, robA, and soxS
genes raises the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli cells by the
common response to general stress, such as superoxide radicals
and antibiotic agents.
Little is known about mechanisms of organic solvent tolerance
in bacterial cells. An energy-dependent export system
may be responsible for the resistance of P. putida S12 to toluene
(20). The mar locus of E. coli may positively influence an
active efflux of chloramphenicol (29). Overexpression of the
alkylhydroperoxide reductase gene increases organic solvent
resistance in E. coli (13). There is a possibility that induction of
the mar regulon activates such efflux pumps or hydroperoxide
reductases.
We observed that overexpression of the stress response
genes increased resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics
but not to several highly hydrophilic antibiotics, including kasugamycin,
gentamicin, kanamycin, and neomycin. All these
drugs are members of the basic oligosaccharide group. It is
suggested that the general stress response system does not
interact with basic oligosaccharide antibiotics or highly hydrophilic
compounds. There is the possibility that activation of the
stress response system by MarA, SoxS, and Rob activators
nonspecifically increases the resistance to hydrophobic chemical
compounds, including organic solvents.
