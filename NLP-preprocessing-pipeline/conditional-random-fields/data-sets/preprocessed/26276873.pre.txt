Lipoxin A4 Attenuates Constitutive and TGF-b1-Dependent Profibrotic Activity in Human Lung Myofibroblasts. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common, progressive, and invariably lethal interstitial lung disease with no effective therapy. The key cell driving the development of fibrosis is the myofibroblast. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an anti-inflammatory lipid, important in the resolution of inflammation, and it has potential antifibrotic activity. However, the effects of LXA4 on primary human lung myofibroblasts (HLMFs) have not previously been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of LXA4 on TGF-b1-dependent responses in IPF- and nonfibrotic control (NFC)-derived HLMFs. HLMFs were isolated from IPF and NFC patients and grown in vitro. The effects of LXA4 on HLMF proliferation, collagen secretion, a-smooth-muscle-actin (aSMA) expression, and Smad2/3 activation were examined constitutively and following TGF-b1 stimulation. The LXA4 receptor (ALXR) was expressed in both NFC- and IPF-derived HLMFs. LXA4 (10(-10) and 10(-8) mol) reduced constitutive aSMA expression, actin stress fiber formation, contraction, and nuclear Smad2/3, indicating regression from a myofibroblast to fibroblast phenotype. LXA4 also significantly inhibited FBS-dependent proliferation and TGF-b1-dependent collagen secretion, aSMA expression, and Smad2/3 nuclear translocation in IPF-derived HLMFs. LXA4 did not inhibit Smad2/3 phosphorylation. In summary, LXA4 attenuated profibrotic HLMF activity and promoted HLMF regression to a quiescent fibroblast phenotype. LXA4 or its stable analogs delivered by aerosol may offer a novel approach to the treatment of IPF.
