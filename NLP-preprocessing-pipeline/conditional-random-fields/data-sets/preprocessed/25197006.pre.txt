Beyond TGFb - Novel ways to target airway and parenchymal fibrosis. Within the lungs, fibrosis can affect both the parenchyma and the airways. Fibrosis is a hallmark pathological change in the parenchyma in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), whilst in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fibrosis is a component of the remodelling of the airways. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding the disease behaviour and pathogenesis of parenchymal and airway fibrosis and as a result a variety of novel therapeutic targets for slowing or preventing progression of these fibrotic changes have been identified. This review highlights a number of these targets and discusses the potential for treating parenchymal or airway fibrosis through these mediators/pathways in the future.
