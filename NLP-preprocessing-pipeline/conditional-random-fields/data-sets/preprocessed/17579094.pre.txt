Thalidomide prevents bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Pulmonary fibrosis in humans can occur as a result of a large number of conditions. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary function becomes progressively compromised resulting in a high mortality rate. Currently there are no proven effective treatments for IPF. We have recently reported that IL-6 and TGF-beta(1) plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of lung fibroblasts, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) prevented bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis through the inhibition of these cytokines. Thalidomide (Thal) has been used in the treatment of multiple myeloma through the inhibitory effect on IL-6-dependent cell growth and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the preventive effect of Thal on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We performed histological examinations and quantitative measurements of IL-6, TGF-beta(1), collagen type Ialpha1 (COL1A1), vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in bleomycin-treated mouse lung tissues with or without the administration of Thal. Thal histologically ameliorated bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mouse lung tissues. Thal decreased the expressions of IL-6, TGF-beta(1), VEGF, Ang-1 Ang-2, and COL1A1 mRNA in mouse lung tissues. In addition, Thal inhibited angiogenesis in the lung. In vitro studies disclosed that Thal reduced 1) production of IL-6, TGF-beta(1), VEGF, Ang-1, and collagen synthesis from human lung fibroblasts, and 2) both IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-beta(1)-dependent transdifferentiation of the cells, which could be the mechanism underlying the preventive effect of Thal on pulmonary fibrosis. These data may provide a rationale to explore clinical use of Thal for the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis.
