Epithelial contribution to the pro-fibrotic stiff microenvironment and myofibroblast population in lung fibrosis. The contribution of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to the pro-fibrotic stiff microenvironment and myofibroblast accumulation in pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. We examined EMT-competent lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts from control (fibrosis-free) donors or patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a very aggressive fibrotic disorder. Cells were cultured on pro-fibrotic conditions including stiff substrata and TGF-b1, and analyzed in terms of morphology, stiffness and expression of EMT/myofibroblast markers and fibrillar collagens. All fibroblasts acquired a robust myofibroblast phenotype upon TGF-b1 stimulation. Yet, IPF-myofibroblasts exhibited higher stiffness and expression of fibrillar collagens than control fibroblasts, concomitantly with enhanced FAK(Y397) activity. FAK inhibition was sufficient to decrease fibroblast stiffness and collagen expression, supporting that FAK(Y397) hyperactivation may underlie the aberrant mechanobiology of IPF-fibroblasts. In contrast, cells undergoing EMT failed to reach the values exhibited by IPF-myofibroblasts in all parameters examined. Likewise, EMT could be distinguished from non-activated control fibroblasts, suggesting that EMT does not elicit myofibroblast precursors either. Our data suggest that EMT does not contribute directly to the myofibroblast population, and may contribute to the stiff fibrotic microenvironment through their own stiffness but not their collagen expression. Our results also support that targeting FAK(Y397) may rescue normal mechanobiology in IPF.
