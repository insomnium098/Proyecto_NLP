Epigenetic Regulation of Caveolin-1 Gene Expression in Lung Fibroblasts. RATIONALE: Fibrotic disorders are associated with tissue accumulation of fibroblasts. We recently showed that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) gene suppression by the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-b1 contributes to fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis-resistance. Cav-1 has been shown to be constitutively suppressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but mechanisms for this suppression are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that epigenetic processes contribute to Cav-1 downregulation in IPF lung fibroblasts, and following fibrogenic stimuli. METHODS: Cav-1 expression levels, DNA methylation status and histone modifications associated with the Cav-1 promoter were examined by PCR, western blots, pyrosequencing or ChIP assays in IPF lung fibroblasts, normal fibroblasts following TGF-b1 stimulation, or in murine lung fibroblasts after bleomycin injury. RESULTS: Methylation-specific-PCR demonstrated methylated and unmethylated Cav-1 DNA copies in all groups. Despite significant changes in Cav-1 expression, no changes in DNA methylation were observed in CpG islands (CGIs) or CGI shores of the Cav-1 promoter by pyrosequencing of lung fibroblasts from IPF lungs, in response to TGF-b1, or after bleomycin-induced murine lung injury, when compared to respective controls. In contrast, the association of Cav-1 promoter with the active histone modification mark, H3K4Me3, correlated with Cav-1 downregulation in activated/fibrotic lung fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that Cav-1 gene silencing in lung fibroblasts is actively regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that involve histone modifications, in particular H3K4Me3, whereas DNA methylation does not appear to be a primary mechanism. These findings support therapeutic strategies that target histone modifications to restore Cav-1 expression in fibroblasts participating in pathogenic tissue remodeling.
