Olodaterol shows anti-fibrotic efficacy in in vitro and in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal respiratory disease characterized by excessive fibroblast activation ultimately leading to scarring of the lungs. Although, the activation of b2--adrenoceptors (b2--AR) has been shown to inhibit pro-fibrotic events primarily in cell lines, the role of b2 -adrenoceptor agonists has not yet been fully characterized. The aim of our study was to explore the anti-fibrotic activity of the long-acting b2 -adrenoceptor agonist olodaterol in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) and in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We assessed the activity of olodaterol to inhibit various pro-fibrotic mechanisms, induced by different pro-fibrotic mediators, in primary HLF from control donors and patients with IPF (IPF-LF). The in vivo anti-fibrotic activity of olodaterol, given once daily by inhalation in either a preventive or therapeutic treatment regimen, was explored in murine models of lung fibrosis induced by either bleomycin or the overexpression of TGF-b1. KEY RESULTS: In both HLF and IPF-LF, olodaterol attenuated TGF-b-induced expression of a-smooth-muscle-actin, fibronectin and endothelin-1 (ET-1), FGF- and PDGF-induced motility and proliferation and TGF-b/ET-1-induced contraction. In vivo olodaterol significantly attenuated the bleomycin-induced increase in lung weight, reduced bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts and inhibited release of pro-fibrotic mediators (TGF-  , MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1). Forced vital capacity was increased only with the preventive treatment regimen. In the TGF-b-overexpressing model, olodaterol additionally reduced the Col3A1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Olodaterol showed anti-fibrotic properties in primary HLF from control and IPF patients and in murine models of lung fibrosis.
