[Potential role of cytokines in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF) and transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) in transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF), and study the potential role of cytokines in the development of IPF. METHODS: The immunohistochemical methods were used to determine the expression of PDGF, TGF-beta in TBLB from patients with IPF. RESULTS: In IPF patients, TGF-beta mainly existed at tiny bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial type-II cells and alveolar macrophages, showing strong expression compared with controls (P<0.01). PDGF mainly existed at fibroblast-like cells surrounding pulmonary vessels, fibroblasts, tiny bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial type-II cells and alveolar macrophages, showing strong expression compared with controls (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: PDGF and TGF-beta, which interact with pulmonary mesenchymal cells, are involved in the formation of pulmonary fibrosis.
