Simvastatin attenuates TGF-b1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human alveolar epithelial cells. BACKGROUND: Transforming-growth-factor-b1 (TGF-b1)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) may contribute to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). TGF-b1-induced EMT in A549 cells (a human AEC cell line) resulted in the adoption of mesenchymal responses that were predominantly mediated via the TGF-b1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Simvastatin (Sim), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has been previously reported to inhibit EMT in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and porcine lens epithelial cells and to suppress Smad2/3 phosphorylation in animal models. However, whether Sim can attenuate TGF-b1-induced EMT in A549 cells and its underlying mechanisms remains unknown. METHODS: Cells were incubated with TGF-b1 in the presence or absence of Sim. The epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-Cad) and the mesenchymal markers, a-smooth-muscle-actin (a-SMA), vimentin (Vi) and fibronectin (FN), were detected using western blotting analyses and immunofluorescence. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels and connective-tissue-growth-factor (CTGF) were analyzed using western blotting. In addition, a cell migration assay was performed. Moreover, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 in the culture medium were examined using ELISA. RESULTS: Sim significantly attenuated the TGF-b1-induced decrease in E-Cad levels and elevated the levels of a-SMA, Vi and FN via the suppression of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Sim inhibited the mesenchymal-like responses in A549 cells, including cell migration, CTGF expression and secretion of MMP-2 and -9. However, Sim failed to reverse the cell morphologial changes induced by TGF-b1 in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Sim attenuated TGF-b1-induced EMT in A549 cells and might be a promising therapeutic agent for treating IPF.
