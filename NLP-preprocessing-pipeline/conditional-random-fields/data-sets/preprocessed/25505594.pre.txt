Assessment of the effect of potential antifibrotic compounds on total and aVb6 integrin-mediated TGF-b activation. Transforming-growth-factor-b (TGF-b) plays an important role in the development of tissue fibrosis, and molecules inhibiting this pathway are attractive therapeutic targets for fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Activation of TGF-b is the rate-limiting step in TGF-b bioavailability, and activation by the aVb6 integrin is important in fibrosis of the lung, liver, and kidney. Activation of TGF-b by aVb6 requires direct cell-cell contact and measurable release of active TGF-b in extracellular fluid compartments does not reflect tissue specific activation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of antifibrotic compounds on both total, and specific aVb6 integrin-mediated TGF-b activity. Using a transformed mink lung cell (TMLC) TGF-b reporter, the effects of potential antifibrotic therapies including an activin-like kinase (Alk5) inhibitor, Dexamethasone, Pirfenidone, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and BIBF1120 were assessed. Effects due to aVb6 integrin-mediated TGF-b activity were measured using reporter cells cocultured with cells expressing aVb6 integrins. These high-throughput studies were validated using a phosphorylated Smad2 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Alk5 inhibitors are potent inhibitors of TGF-b activity, whereas the novel antifibrotics, Pirfenidone, BIBF1120, and NAC are only moderate inhibitors, and Dexamethasone does not specifically affect TGF-bactivity, but inhibits TGF-b-induced gene expression. None of the current small molecular inhibitors inhibit aVb6-mediated TGF-b activity. These results demonstrate the potential of this high-throughput assay of aVb6-specific TGF-b activity and illustrate that currently available antifibrotics have limited effects on aVb6 integrin-mediated TGF-b activity.
