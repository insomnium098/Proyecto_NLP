TGF-b activation and lung fibrosis. Lung fibrosis can affect the parenchyma and the airways, classically giving rise to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in the parenchyma or airway remodeling in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. TGF-b activation has been implicated in the fibrosis of both IPF and airway remodeling. However, the mechanisms of TGF-b activation appear to differ depending on the cellular and anatomical compartments, with implications on disease pathogenesis. Although it appears that epithelial cell activation of TGF-b by the avb6 integrin is central in IPF, mesenchymal activation of TGF-b by the avb5 and avb8 integrins appears to predominate in airway remodeling. Interestingly, the mechanism of TGF-b by the integrins avb6 and avb5 is shared, relying on cytoskeletal changes, whereas activation of TGF-b by the avb8 integrin is distinct, relying on proteolytic cleavage of the latency-associated peptide of TGF-b by matrix metalloproteinase 14. This article describes the mechanisms through which epithelial cells activate TGF-b by the avb6 integrin and mesenchymal cells activate TGF-b by the avb5 integrin, and highlights their roles in lung fibrosis.
