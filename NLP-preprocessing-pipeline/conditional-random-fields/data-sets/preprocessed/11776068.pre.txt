The potential role of PDGF, IGF-1, TGF-beta expression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: To identify the role of cytokines involved in the development of lung fibrosis in patients with idiopathic-pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS: Proteins and gene expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) were measured in alveolar macrophages and open lung biopsies from patients with IPF using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: In specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), PDGF-A, PDGF-B, IGF-1, TGF-beta were localized in alveolar macrophages. Evaluation of open lung biopsies from patients with IPF showed that IGF-1 was prominently present in pulmonary vessel walls in fibrotic lesions. PDGF and TGF-beta proteins were localized to hyperplastic bronchio-alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Our in situ hybridization results were consistent with that of immunohistochemistry except that PDGF-A and TGF-beta mRNA transcripts were not detected in bronchoalveolar epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that (1) alveolar macrophages play key roles not only in inflammation but also in the fibrotic process by releasing PDGF, IGF-1 and TGF-beta; (2) IGF-1 could be responsible for angiogenesis in IPF; (3) PDGF, TGF-beta are associated with fibroplasia and the deposition of extracellular matrix, as well as vessel remodeling and epithelial cell repopularization.
