Early growth response transcription factors: key mediators of fibrosis and novel targets for anti-fibrotic therapy. Fibrosis is a deregulated and ultimately defective form of tissue repair that underlies a large number of chronic human diseases, as well as obesity and aging. The pathogenesis of fibrosis involves multiple cell types and extracellular signals, of which transforming growth factor-   (TGF-  ) is pre-eminent. The prevalence of fibrosis is rising worldwide, and to date no agents has shown clinical efficacy in the attenuating or reversing the process. Recent studies implicate the immediate-early response transcription factor Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Egr-1 couples acute changes in the cellular environment to sustained alterations in gene expression, and mediates a broad spectrum of biological responses to injury and stress. In contrast to other ligand-activated transcription factors such as NF-kB, c-jun and Smad2/3 that undergo post-translational modification such as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, Egr-1 activity is regulated via its biosynthesis. Aberrant Egr-1 expression or activity is implicated in cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and ischemic injury and recent studies now indicate an important role for Egr-1 in TGF-  -dependent profibrotic responses. Fibrosis in various animal models and human diseases such as scleroderma (SSc) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is accompanied by aberrant Egr-1 expression. Moreover Egr-1 appears to be required for physiologic and pathological connective tissue remodeling, and Egr-1-null mice are protected from fibrosis. As a novel profibrotic mediator, Egr-1 thus appears to be a promising potential target for the development of anti-fibrotic therapies.
