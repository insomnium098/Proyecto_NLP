TGF-beta-1, but not TGF-beta 2 or TGF-beta 3, is differentially present in epithelial cells of advanced pulmonary fibrosis: an immunohistochemical study. Although it is recognized that three isoforms of transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) exist in mammals, their expression, distribution, and function in injury and repair are not well characterized. Using immunohistochemistry and antibodies to synthetic peptides of TGF-beta-1, TGF-beta 2, and TGF-beta 3, we determined the distribution of TGF-beta isoforms in lung sections with acute and chronic lesions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic asbestosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, as well as non-specific pneumonitis. In lung sections with advanced pulmonary fibrosis and honeycombing, irrespective of the diagnosis, TGF-beta-1 was prominently expressed in epithelial cells and macrophages and was found to be associated with the extracellular matrix. In lungs with early lesions of IPF and only inflammatory changes, TGF-beta-1 was present in alveolar macrophages but TGF-beta-1 was not present in epithelial cells. Small amounts of matrix-associated TGF-beta-1 were present subepithelially in areas of lung sections from patients with IPF with minimal inflammation and no fibrosis. In normal lungs with no evidence of inflammation or fibrosis TGF-beta-1 was not seen in alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, or extracellularly. TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 were expressed in alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of vessels and bronchi of normal lungs and lungs with both inflammatory and fibrotic changes. Our findings suggest that while TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 are ubiquitously expressed in the lung, TGF-beta-1 is expressed in epithelial cells of fibrotic lungs where the presence of TGF-beta-1 is not disease-specific but an indication of the chronicity of the injury.
