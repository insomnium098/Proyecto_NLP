Transforming-growth-factor-b inhibits IQ motif containing guanosine triphosphatase activating protein  1 expression in lung fibroblasts via the nuclear factor-kB signaling pathway. UNASSIGNED: IQ motif containing guanosine triphosphatase activating protein  1 (IQGAP1) is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrogenesis (IPF); however, characterization of the expression of IQGAP1 in lung fibroblasts has remained elusive. The present study therefore evaluated IQGAP1 expression in mouse and human lung fibroblasts under fibrotic conditions via western blot analysis. It was revealed that IQGAP1 expression levels were significantly decreased in lung fibroblasts isolated from bleomycin  -challenged mice than in those of control mice. Transforming growth factor  -b (TGF  -b) induced differentiation, as well as decreased expression of IQGAP1 in WI  -38  cells human lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)  -kB activation restored the TGF  -b  -induced inhibition of IQGAP1 expression in WI  -38  cells. In lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)  -challenged WI  -38  cells, the expression of IQGAP1 was also decreased, while neutralized anti  -TGF  -b antibody treatment restored the LPA  -induced inhibition of IQGAP1 expression. These data indicated that TGF  -b inhibited IQGAP1 expression in lung fibroblasts via the NF  -kB signaling pathway, presenting a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IPF.
