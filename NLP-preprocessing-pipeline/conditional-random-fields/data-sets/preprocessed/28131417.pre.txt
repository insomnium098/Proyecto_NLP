miR-18a-5p Inhibits Sub-pleural Pulmonary Fibrosis by Targeting TGF-b Receptor II. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease that typically leads to respiratory failure and death within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis is a pathological hallmark of IPF. Bleomycin treatment of mice is a an established pulmonary fibrosis model. We recently showed that bleomycin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to pleural mesothelial cell (PMC) migration and sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. However, changes in miRNA expression in PMCs and sub-pleural fibrosis have not been reported. Using cultured PMCs and a pulmonary fibrosis animal model, we found that miR-18a-5p was reduced in PMCs treated with bleomycin and that downregulation of miR-18a-5p contributed to EMT of PMCs. Furthermore, we determined that miR-18a-5p binds to the 3' UTR region of transforming-growth-factor-b receptor II (TGF-bRII) mRNA, and this is associated with reduced TGF-bRII expression and suppression of TGF-b-Smad2/3 signaling. Overexpression of miR-18a-5p prevented bleomycin-induced EMT of PMC and inhibited bleomycin-induced sub-pleural fibrosis in mice. Taken together, our data indicate that downregulated miR-18a-5p mediates sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis through upregulation of its target, TGF-bRII, and that overexpression of miR-18a-5p might therefore provide a novel approach to the treatment of IPF.
