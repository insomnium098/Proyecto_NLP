BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
N-acetylcysteine	NN
(	(
NAC	NN

can	MD
act	VB
as	IN
an	DT

OBJECTIVE	NN
:	:
In	IN
this	DT

we	PRP
investigated	VBD
the	DT

DESIGN	NN
:	:
AMs	NNS

harvested	VBN
by	IN
bronchoalveolar	JJ

(	(

from	IN
16	CD

in	IN
the	DT

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
NAC	NN
suppressed	VBD
the	DT
production	NN
of	IN
TNF-alpha	NN
,	,
its	PRP$
soluble	JJ
receptors	NNS

and	CC
TGF-beta1	NN
by	IN
AMs	NNS
in	IN
a	DT
dose-dependent	JJ
manner	NN

At	IN
the	DT
highest	JJS
concentration	NN
of	IN
NAC	NN
(	(
10	CD

,	,
the	DT
spontaneous	JJ

LPS-stimulated	JJ
production	NN
ofTNF-alpha	NN
,	,
sTNFR1	NN
,	,
sTNFR2	NN
,	,
and	CC
TGF-beta1	NN
were	VBD
significantly	RB
reduced	VBN

The	DT
LPS-stimulated	JJ
IL-1beta	NN
production	NN
was	VBD
also	RB
suppressed	VBN
by	IN
10	CD

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
NAC	NN
has	VBZ
the	DT
potential	JJ
to	TO
down-regulate	VB
the	DT
production	NN
of	IN
TNF-alpha	NN
and	CC
their	PRP$
