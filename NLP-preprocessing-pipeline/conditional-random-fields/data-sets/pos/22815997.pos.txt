METHODS	NNS
:	:
Human	JJ
lung	NN
tissues	NNS
from	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
were	VBD
analyzed	VBN
for	IN
autophagy	NN
markers	NNS
and	CC
modulating	VBG

To	TO
study	VB
the	DT

of	IN
TGF-b	NN
(	(

on	IN
autophagy	NN

human	JJ
lung	NN

experiments	NNS
were	VBD
done	VBN
using	VBG
the	DT

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Lung	NN
tissues	NNS
from	IN
IPF	NN
patients	NNS
demonstrate	VBP

In	IN
the	DT

of	IN
pulmonary	JJ

,	,
rapamycin	NN

is	VBZ
antifibrotic	JJ

of	IN
-	:
smooth	JJ

Inhibition	NN
of	IN
key	JJ

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
Autophagy	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
