BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
is	VBZ
a	DT
rapid	JJ
progressive	JJ
fibro-proliferative	JJ
disorder	NN
with	IN
poor	JJ
prognosis	NN
similar	JJ
to	TO
lung	NN
cancer	NN
.	.

The	DT
pathogenesis	NN
of	IN
IPF	NN
is	VBZ
uncertain	JJ
,	,
but	CC
loss	NN
of	IN
epithelial	JJ
cells	NNS
and	CC
fibroblast	NN
proliferation	NN
are	VBP
thought	VBN
to	TO
be	VB
central	JJ
processes	NNS
.	.

Previous	JJ
reports	NNS
have	VBP
shown	VBN
that	IN
BARD1	NN
expression	NN
is	VBZ
upregulated	VBN
in	IN
response	NN
to	TO
hypoxia	NN
and	CC
associated	VBN
with	IN
TGF-b	NN
signaling	NN
,	,
both	CC
recognized	VBD
factors	NNS
driving	VBG
lung	NN

.	.

Differentially	RB
spliced	VBN
BARD1	NN
isoforms	NNS
,	,
in	IN
particular	JJ
BARD1b	NN
,	,
are	VBP
oncogenic	JJ
drivers	NNS
of	IN
proliferation	NN
in	IN
cancers	NNS
of	IN
various	JJ
origins	NNS
.	.

We	PRP
therefore	RB
hypothesized	VBD
that	IN
BARD1	NN
and/or	CC
its	PRP$
isoforms	NNS
might	MD
play	VB
a	DT
role	NN
in	IN
lung	NN
fibrosis	NN
.	.

METHODS	NNS
:	:
We	PRP
investigated	VBD
BARD1	NN
expression	NN
as	IN
a	DT
function	NN
of	IN
TGF-b	NN
in	IN
cultured	VBN
cells	NNS
,	,
in	IN
mice	NNS
with	IN
experimentally	RB
induced	VBN
lung	NN
fibrosis	NN
,	,
and	CC
in	IN
lung	NN
biopsies	NNS
from	IN
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
patients	NNS
.	.

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
FL	NN
BARD1	NN
and	CC
BARD1b	NN
were	VBD
upregulated	VBN
in	IN
response	NN
to	TO
TGF-b	NN
in	IN
epithelial	JJ
cells	NNS
and	CC
fibroblasts	NNS
in	FW

and	CC
in	FW
vivo	FW
.	.

Protein	NN
and	CC
mRNA	NN
expression	NN
studies	NNS
showed	VBD
very	RB
low	JJ
expression	NN
in	IN
healthy	JJ
lung	NN
tissues	NNS
,	,
but	CC
upregulated	VBN
expression	NN
of	IN
full	JJ
length	NN
(	(
FL	NN
)	)
BARD1	NN
and	CC
BARD1b	NN
in	IN
fibrotic	JJ
tissues	NNS
.	.

CONCLUSION	NN
:	:
Our	PRP$
data	NNS
suggest	VBP
that	IN
FL	NN
BARD1	NN
and	CC
BARD1b	NN
might	MD
be	VB
mediators	NNS
of	IN
pleiotropic	JJ
effects	NNS
of	IN
TGF-b	NN
.	.

In	IN
particular	JJ
BARD1b	NN
might	MD
be	VB
a	DT
driver	NN
of	IN
proliferation	NN
and	CC
of	IN
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
pathogenesis	NN
and	CC
progression	NN
and	CC
represent	VBP
a	DT
