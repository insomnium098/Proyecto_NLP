The	DT

Two	CD

as	IN

the	DT
ubiquitin/de-ubiquitination	JJ
system	NN

has	VBZ

well	RB

however	RB

the	DT

Here	RB
we	PRP
reveal	VBP
that	IN
a	DT
de-ubiquitinating	JJ

USP11	NN

promotes	VBZ
TGFb-1	NN

We	PRP
elucidate	VBP
the	DT

that	WDT

an	DT
USP11	NN

the	DT

Inhibition	NN

Subsequently	RB
,	,
TGFb-1	NN

as	IN

the	DT

as	IN

Overexpression	NN

reduces	VBZ

thereby	RB
elevating	VBG

the	DT

Further	RB

elevated	JJ

Therefore	RB

USP11	NN
