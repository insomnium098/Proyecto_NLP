OBJECTIVES	NNS

Hepatocyte-growth-factor	NN
(	(
HGF	NN

HGF	NN

HGFA-specific	JJ
inhibitors	NNS

Our	PRP$

that	IN
fibroblasts	NNS

idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ

(	(

METHODS	NNS

We	PRP

MAIN	NNP
RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
activated	VBD
pro-HGF	NN
in	FW

Pro-HGF	JJ
activation	NN
was	VBD
inhibited	VBN

by	IN
an	DT
anti-HGFA	JJ

by	IN
HAI-1	NN
and	CC
HAI-2	NN

Pro-HGF	JJ
activation	NN
by	IN
IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
was	VBD
reduced	VBN
compared	VBN
with	IN
control	JJ
fibroblasts	NNS

In	IN
IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
,	,
HGFA	NN
expression	NN
was	VBD
lower	JJR
and	CC
HAI-1	NN
and	CC
HAI-2	NN
expression	NN
was	VBD
higher	JJR
compared	VBN

control	JJ
fibroblasts	NNS

PGE	NNP
(	(
2	LS

stimulated	VBN
pro-HGF	NN
activation	NN
through	IN
increased	VBN
expression	NN
of	IN
HGFA	NN
and	CC
decreased	VBD
expression	NN
of	IN
its	PRP$
inhibitor	NN
HAI-2	NN

In	IN
contrast	NN
,	,
TGF-beta	NN
(	(
1	CD

reduced	VBD
the	DT
ability	NN
of	IN
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
to	TO
activate	VB
pro-HGF	NN
through	IN
decreased	VBN
expression	NN
of	IN
HGFA	NN

CONCLUSIONS	NNS

IPF	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
have	VBP
a	DT
