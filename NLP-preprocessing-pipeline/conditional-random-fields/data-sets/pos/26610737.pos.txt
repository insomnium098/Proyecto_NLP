BACKGROUND	NN
AND	CC
OBJECTIVE	NN
:	:
IPF	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
form	NN
of	IN
interstitial	JJ
pneumonia	NN
of	IN
unknown	JJ
origin	NN
that	WDT
has	VBZ
a	DT

prognosis	NN
for	IN
which	WDT
current	JJ
treatments	NNS
are	VBP

Recent	JJ
studies	NNS
have	VBP
shown	VBN
that	IN
EMT	NN
plays	VBZ
a	DT
role	NN
in	IN
IPF	NN

L1-CAM	NN
has	VBZ
also	RB
been	VBN
linked	VBN

EMT	NNP

Our	PRP$
aim	NN
was	VBD
to	TO
determine	VB
prospectively	RB
the	DT

L1-CAM	NN
in	IN

Forty	CD

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
BALF	NN
sL1-CAM	NN

BALF	NN

Besides	IN

serum	NN
sL1-CAM	NN

The	DT

in	IN
patients	NNS

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
The	DT
concentrations	NNS
of	IN
sL1-CAM	NN
both	CC
in	IN
BALF	NN
and	CC
in	IN
serum	NN

patients	NNS

are	VBP
markedly	RB

This	DT
indicates	VBZ
that	IN
L1-CAM	NN
might	MD
be	VB

in	IN
the	DT
