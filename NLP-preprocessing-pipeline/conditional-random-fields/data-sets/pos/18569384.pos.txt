Previously	RB
we	PRP
showed	VBD
that	IN

TGFbeta	NN
(	(

are	VBP

particularly	RB
at	IN

We	PRP
also	RB
showed	VBD
that	IN

Importantly	RB

Recently	RB
we	PRP
reported	VBD
that	IN

The	DT

In	IN

this	DT

in	IN
a	DT

Thus	RB

we	PRP
recently	RB
reported	VBD
that	IN

Now	RB
,	,
in	IN
preliminary	JJ
findings	NNS
,	,
we	PRP
have	VBP
shown	VBN
that	IN

This	DT

plus	IN

the	DT
concept	NN
that	IN

in	FW

latent	JJ
TGFbeta	NN

is	VBZ

consequently	RB

Taken	VBN
together	RB

these	DT

support	VBP
the	DT

that	IN

that	IN
