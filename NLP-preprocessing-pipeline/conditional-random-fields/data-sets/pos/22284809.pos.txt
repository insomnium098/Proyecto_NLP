BACKGROUND	NN
:	:
Transforming-growth-factor-b1	NN
(	(
TGF-b1	NN
)	)
is	VBZ
a	DT
profibrotic	JJ
cytokine	NN
that	WDT
plays	VBZ
a	DT
major	JJ
role	NN
in	IN
vascular	JJ
biology	NN
,	,
and	CC
is	VBZ
known	VBN
to	TO
regulate	VB
the	DT
phenotype	NN
and	CC
activity	NN
of	IN
various	JJ
vascular	JJ
cell	NN
populations	NNS
.	.

Because	IN
most	JJS
fibrotic	JJ
diseases	NNS
,	,
such	JJ
as	IN
idiopathic	JJ
pulmonary	JJ
fibrosis	NN
(	(
IPF	NN
)	)
,	,
are	VBP
associated	VBN
with	IN
vascular	JJ
remodeling	NN
,	,
and	CC
as	IN
endothelial	JJ
progenitor	NN
cells	NNS
(	(
EPCs	NNS
)	)
may	MD
be	VB
involved	VBN
in	IN
this	DT
process	NN
,	,
we	PRP
investigated	VBD
the	DT
impact	NN
of	IN
TGF-b1	NN
modulation	NN
of	IN
EPC	NNP
angiogenic	JJ
properties	NNS

METHODS	NNS
:	:
TGF-b1	NN
plasma	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
determined	VBN
in	IN
64	CD
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
and	CC
compared	VBN
with	IN
those	DT
in	IN

The	DT
effect	NN
of	IN
TGF-b1	NN
on	IN
angiogenesis	NN
was	VBD
studied	VBN
in	FW

in	IN
a	DT
Matrigel	NNP

and	CC
in	FW

on	IN
endothelial	JJ
colony-forming	JJ

(	(
ECFCs	NNS

We	PRP
studied	VBD
the	DT

of	IN
the	DT
three	CD
main	JJ

of	IN
TGF-b1	NN
in	IN

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
Total	JJ
TGF-b1	NN
plasma	NN
levels	NNS
were	VBD
significantly	RB
increased	VBN
in	IN
patients	NNS
with	IN
IPF	NN
as	IN
compared	VBN
with	IN
controls	NNS
(	(
P	NN

.	.

TGF-b1	NN
had	VBD
proangiogenic	JJ
effects	NNS
in	FW

by	IN
increasing	VBG

in	IN
Matrigel	NNP

C57/Bl6	NN
mice	NNS

and	CC
in	FW

by	IN

The	DT
effects	NNS
were	VBD
abolished	VBN

CONCLUSIONS	NNS
:	:
TGF-b1	NN
is	VBZ
proangiogenic	JJ
in	FW

and	CC
induces	VBZ
ECFC	NNP
angiogenic	JJ

suggesting	VBG
that	IN
TGF-b1	NN
may	MD
