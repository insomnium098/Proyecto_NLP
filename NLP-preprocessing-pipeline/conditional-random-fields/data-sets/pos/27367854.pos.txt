may	MD

some	DT

as	IN
an	DT
anti-fibrotic	JJ

Recent	JJ

have	VBP
shown	VBN
that	IN

The	DT
aim	NN
of	IN
this	DT
study	NN
was	VBD
to	TO
determine	VB
whether	IN

might	MD
be	VB
useful	JJ
to	TO

therefore	RB
whether	IN
the	DT

METHODS	NNS

Primary	JJ

RESULTS	NNS
:	:
This	DT
study	NN
showed	VBD
that	IN
low	JJ
concentrations	NNS
of	IN
Resveratrol	NNP
(	(
<	JJR
=	JJ
50	CD
M	NN
)	)
had	VBD
no	DT

on	IN
N1	NN
or	CC
primary	JJ

proliferation	NN
,	,
apoptosis	NN

or	CC
COL1	NN
or	CC

but	CC
repressed	VBD
and	CC
reversed	VBD
myofibroblast	NN
phenoconversion	NN
.	.

As	IN
expected	VBN
,	,
these	DT
same	JJ
effects	NNS
were	VBD
observed	VBN
for	IN
IPF	NN
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
though	IN
higher	JJR
levels	NNS
of	IN
Resveratrol	NNP
(	(
>	JJR
=	JJ
100uM	NN
)	)
were	VBD
required	VBN
.	.

Taken	VBN
together	RB
,	,
these	DT
data	NNS
suggest	VBP
that	IN
,	,
like	IN
lung	NN
fibroblasts	NNS
,	,
prostate	NN
fibroblast	NN
to	TO
myofibroblast	NN
phenoconversion	NN
can	MD
be	VB
both	CC
repressed	VBN
and	CC
reversed	VBN
by	IN
Resveratrol	NN
treatment	NN
.	.

Thus	RB
,	,
anti-fibrotic	JJ
therapeutics	NNS
might	MD
be	VB
efficacious	JJ
for	IN
the	DT
treatment	NN
of	IN
LUTD	NN
