Signalling pathways from NADPH oxidase-4 to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This review focuses on the roles of NADPH oxidase/NOX proteins in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathophysiology and in the signalling pathways involved in IPF. NOX proteins are membrane-associated multi-unit enzymes that catalyze the reduction of oxygen using NADPH as an electron donor. Recent studies indicate that NOX4 is induced in pulmonary fibroblasts in response to TGF-b. TGF-b or PDGF induce myofibroblast proliferation, differentiation, migration, contractility and extracellular matrix production, through NOX4 and reactive oxygen species dependent SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. NOX4 is increased in pulmonary fibroblasts from IPF patients and deletion of Nox4 in mice prevents bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. These data strongly suggest that targeting of NOX4 could be a step forward in the treatment of fibrotic lung diseases, by specifically targeting myofibroblasts, a major player in this disease.
