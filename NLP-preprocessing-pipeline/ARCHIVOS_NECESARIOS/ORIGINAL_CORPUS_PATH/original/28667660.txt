Signaling pathways and their miRNA regulators involved in the etiopathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) belong to heterogenic group of interstitial lung diseases (ILD). For the reason that this group of diseases present with complex clinical non-specific features, they represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In this review we focus on several crucial signaling pathways participating in inflammation, fibrosis and EMT processes, so important in the course of ILD: TNF-a/NFkb, TGF-b/SMAD, Wnt-b-catenin and PI3K-Akt signaling. Moreover, this review summarizes the role of selected signaling pathways and some miRNAs which are their regulators during development and progression of IPF and HP. Recent advances indicate the potential role of miRNAs as a molecular markers differentiating clinical course of ILD.
