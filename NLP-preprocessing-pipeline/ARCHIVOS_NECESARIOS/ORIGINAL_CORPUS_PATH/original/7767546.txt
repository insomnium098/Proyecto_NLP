Increased interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A compartmental analysis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood interstitial disease that usually proves refractory to therapy and results in irreversible tissue scarring and pulmonary dysfunction. Previous investigations have suggested a number of possible mediators of inflammation and fibrosis that typify IPF. We report increases in lung interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) content in patients with IPF, as compared with normal control subjects. Importantly, this increase in IRAP was not accompanied by concomitant increases in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), resulting in a local environment that may be profibrotic. Tissue homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with IPF both demonstrate elevated IRAP content compared with that in normal subjects. Immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization localize IRAP to hyperplastic type II pneumocytes, macrophages, and local stromal cells. Finally, in vitro studies utilizing fibroblasts isolated from patients with IPF demonstrated no difference in constitutive IRAP production compared with that in normal subjects, but they revealed an exaggerated response to stimulation with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). These findings suggest that the fibrotic tissue changes of IPF and possibly other chronic interstitial lung diseases may result in part from the local effects of IRAP, and they also demonstrate that pulmonary nonimmune cells may influence local tissue changes through the elaboration of IRAP.
