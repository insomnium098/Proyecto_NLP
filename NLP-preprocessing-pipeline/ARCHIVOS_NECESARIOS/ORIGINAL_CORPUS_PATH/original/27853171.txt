De-ubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, promotes transforming growth factor b-1 signaling through stabilization of transforming growth factor b receptor II. The transforming growth factor b-1 (TGFb-1) signaling pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Two TGFb-1 receptors, TbRI and TbRII, mediate this pathway. TbRI protein stability, as mediated by the ubiquitin/de-ubiquitination system, has been well studied; however, the molecular regulation of TbRII still remains unclear. Here we reveal that a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, promotes TGFb-1 signaling through de-ubiquitination and stabilization of TbRII. We elucidate the role that mitoxantrone (MTX), an USP11 inhibitor, has in the attenuation of TGFb-1 signaling. Inhibition or downregulation of USP11 results in increases in TbRII ubiquitination and reduction of TbRII stability. Subsequently, TGFb-1 signaling is greatly attenuated, as shown by the decreases in phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 levels as well as that of fibronectin (FN) and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Overexpression of USP11 reduces TbRII ubiquitination and increases TbRII stabilization, thereby elevating phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and the ultimate expression of FN and SMA. Further, elevated expression of USP11 and TbRII were detected in lung tissues from bleomycin-challenged mice and IPF patients. Therefore, USP11 may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by stabilization of TbRII and promotion of TGFb-1 signaling. This study provides mechanistic evidence for development of USP11 inhibitors as potential antifibrotic drugs for pulmonary fibrosis.
