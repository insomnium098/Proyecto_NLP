Cub domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) negatively regulates TGFb signaling and myofibroblast differentiation. Fibroblasts are thought to be the prime cell type for producing and secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the connective tissue. The profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFb1) activates and transdifferentiates fibroblasts into aSMA-expressing myofibroblasts, which exhibit increased ECM secretion, in particular collagens. Little information, however, exists about cell-surface molecules on fibroblasts that mediate this transdifferentiation process. We recently identified, using unbiased cell-surface proteome analysis, Cub domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) to be strongly downregulated by TGFb1. CDCP1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, the expression and role of which has not been investigated in lung fibroblasts to date. Here, we characterized, in detail, the effect of TGFb1 on CDCP1 expression and function, using immunofluorescence, FACS, immunoblotting, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDCP1. CDCP1 is present on interstitial fibroblasts, but not myofibroblasts, in the normal and IPF lung. In vitro, TGFb1 decreased CDCP1 expression in a time-dependent manner by impacting mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of CDCP1 enhanced a TGFb1-mediated cell adhesion of fibroblasts. Importantly, CDCP1-depleted cells displayed an enhanced expression of profibrotic markers, such as collagen V or aSMA, which was found to be independent of TGFb1. Our data show, for the very first time, that loss of CDCP1 contributes to fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation via a potential negative feedback loop between CDCP1 expression and TGFb1 stimulation.
