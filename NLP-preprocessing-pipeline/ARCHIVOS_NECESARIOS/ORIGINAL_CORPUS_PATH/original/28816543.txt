MiR-541-5p regulates lung fibrosis by targeting cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1A. AIM OF THE STUDY: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal human disease with short survival time and few treatment options. In this study, we aim to demonstrate that cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A), a Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulating PDE family member, plays a critical role in the induction of fibrosis and angiogenesis in the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce pulmonary damage, adult male SD rats were treated with bleomycin in a dose of 6 mg/kg body weight by a single intratracheal instillation. For in vivo silencing of PDE1A in rat lung, a nonspecific control siRNA or PDE1A-specific siRNA was used to treat rat through nasal instillation. Human normal pulmonary fibroblasts MRC-5 and hFL1 and rat lung fibroblasts were used as in vitro model. Immunohistochemistry and immunoflurescence staining were performed to detect PDE1A and a-SMA expression. Reverse transcription-qPCR was performed to detect microRNA and mRNA expression. In vitro wound healing assay was performed to detect pulmonary fibroblasts'mortality ability. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that PDE1A can stimulate lung fibroblasts to undergo myofibroblastic changes. This led to the identification of miR-541-5p as one of the miRNA candidates associated with bleomycin response. We found that miR-541-5p expression is downregulated in TGF-b-treated lung fibroblasts and the rat pulmonary fibrosis model. Overexpression of miR-541-5p in lung fibroblasts inhibited mortality of human lung fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-541-5p is a key effector in lung fibroblastsby by regulating PDE1A expression at protein translation level and its overexpression is protective against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.
