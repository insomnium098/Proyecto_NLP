The potential application of strategic released apigenin from polymeric carrier in pulmonary fibrosis. AIM: The capability of reducing fibrotic and inflammatory responses in lung tissues represents a gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A wide variety of therapeutic strategies have been employed in clinic to treat PF, but limited success has been obtained. Apigenin (4, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is a member of flavonoid family that exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects. In this study, we explore the potential therapeutic effect of apigenin in lung fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apigenin was employed to treat IPF in a bleomycin-induced PF rat model. Apigenin was loaded onto a biodegradable polymer carrier (nanoparticle, NP) to improve its bio-solubility and bio-availability. The properties (e.g. size, apigenin loading and release profile) of the apigenin loaded polymer carrier were well-characterized. In vitro study was performed to assess the impact of apigenin on pulmonary cell viability, growth, as well as inflammatory and pro-fibrosis responses in pulmonary cells. The impact of apigenin on the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TGF-b, TNF-a) and pro-fibrosis factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pulmonary cells from lung tissues was also investigated. RESULTS: Our results showed, apigenin has anti-fibrosis effect by inhibition fibrosis related cytokines expression. And compared with apigenin in soluble form, the strategic release of apigenin is more effective in inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggested that apigenin loaded on polymeric carrier might be an effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis patients.
