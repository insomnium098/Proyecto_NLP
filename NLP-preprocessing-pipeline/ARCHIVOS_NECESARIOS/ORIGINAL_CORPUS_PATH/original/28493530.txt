M2 macrophages induce EMT through the TGF-b/Smad2 signaling pathway. IPF is characterized by fibroblast accumulation, collagen deposition and ECM remodeling, with myofibroblasts believed to be the effector cell type. Myofibroblasts develop due to EMT of lung alveolar epithelial cells, which can be induced by TGF-b. M2 macrophages, a macrophage subpopulation, secrete large amounts of TGF-b. To clarify the relationship between IPF, EMT, TGF-b and M2 macrophages, a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used. Seventeen days after mice were treated with bleomycin, the successful establishment of a pulmonary fibrosis model was confirmed by HE stain and Masson's trichrome stain. We found evidence in support of EMT, such as elevated protein levels of a-SMA in lung tissue and decreased levels of E-cadherin and CK-18. Additionally, increased TGF-b levels and TGF-b/Smad2 signaling activation was observed. Macrophages were recruited to pulmonary alveoli. Alveolar macrophages were phenotyped and identified as M2 macrophages, with up-regulated CD206 on the cell surfaces. For in vitro studies, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with IL-4 for 24 h, and the cells were then utilized as M2 macrophages. TGF-b levels increased significantly in the culture supernatant. Forty-eight hours after lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were co-cultured with the M2 macrophages, the expression of a-SMA increased, and E-cadherin and CK-18 decreased. When a TGF-b receptor inhibitor, LY2109761 was used, the EMT induced by M2 macrophages was blocked. In conclusion, we demonstrated that M2 macrophages induce EMT through the TGF-b/Smad2 signaling pathway.
