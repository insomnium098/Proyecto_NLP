Activated human T lymphocytes inhibit TGFb-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation via prostaglandins D2 and E2. In pulmonary fibrosis (PF), fibroblasts and myofibroblasts proliferate and deposit excessive extracellular matrix in the interstitium, impairing normal lung function. As most forms of PF have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options, PF represents an urgent unmet need for novel, effective therapeutics. While the role of immune cells in lung fibrosis is unclear, recent studies suggest that T lymphocyte (T cell) activation may be impaired in PF patients. Further, we have previously shown that activated T cells can produce prostaglandins with anti-scarring potential. Here, we test the hypothesis that activated T cells directly inhibit myofibroblast differentiation using a co-culture system. Co-culture with activated primary blood-derived T cells, from both healthy human donors and PF patients, inhibited transforming growth factor beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation in primary human lung fibroblasts isolated from either normal or PF lung tissue. Co-culture supernatants contained anti-fibrotic prostaglandins D2 and E2, and the inhibitory effect of co-culture on myofibroblast differentiation was largely reversed when prostaglandin production was abrogated either by resting the T cells prior to co-culture, or via specific pharmacological inhibitors. Moreover, co-culture conditions induced COX-2 in HLFs, but not in T cells, suggesting that T cells deliver an activating signal to HLFs, which in turn produce anti-fibrotic prostaglandins. We show for the first time that co-culture with activated primary human T lymphocytes strongly inhibits myofibroblast differentiation, revealing a novel cell-to-cell communication network with therapeutic implications for fibrotic lung diseases.
